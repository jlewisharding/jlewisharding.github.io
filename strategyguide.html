<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
</div>
<div id="game-meta" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Game Meta</strong></h1>
<p>Last War: Survival can be considered a game in two phases.</p>
<p>Initially, the gameplay takes the form of the scrolling zombie battle
game that you see advertised on social media all the time. While this
type of game play remains a part of the game to some extent, it’s mostly
used as a way to get people sucked into playing the game while they get
you hooked on the second phase (hoping you’ll stick around and spend
money).</p>
<p>The second phase of game play is all about strategic base
development. It’s like SIM City, Age of Empires, and other classic
empire building game formats. What perhaps make this game a little
different (and more fun in my opinion), is the intentional design to
make joining an alliance essential. While there are certainly ways to
enjoy the game playing on your own (more about that here), the Devs have
clearly made the majority of the focus the events and tasks that are
oriented around cooperation with your alliance and combat against other
alliances and servers.</p>
<p><br> <br> <br></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="alliance-duel-weekly-vs-battle-strategy"
class="section level1">
<h1>Alliance Duel: Weekly VS Battle Strategy</h1>
<p>Alliance duel is one of the biggest parts of this game. Some would
argue it’s the main point of the game. The idea is that 6 out of 7 days
each will, alliance members complete in-game tasks that earn points for
your alliance. Every day has a different theme. To maximize your
performance, you not only have to do the correct tasks on the optimal
day, but you have to be patient and plan on the other 6 days to ensure
you aren’t wasting “future” points. It’s definitely a balance.</p>
<p>It’s important to know that Last War:Surival is a <em>pay to win</em>
game. In other words, you can employ all of the strategy you can and
play this game 24/7, and you’ll still not stand a chance again people
who spend actual real-world money on the game (you can read more of my
thoughts on spending real money here). That being said, you can grind
your way to success and can often win by being smart instead of
rich.</p>
<p>The first step to playing smart is to upgrade your Aliance Duel tech
in the Tech Center.</p>
<div id="the-tech-center" class="section level2">
<h2>The Tech Center</h2>
<p>Every HQ has at least one Tech Center. You can purchase a second tech
center for $9.99, which is not required, but it will drastically improve
your ability to grow in the game.I intentionally don’t pressure people
to spend money on this game. However, the second Tech Center makes my
list of Top 5 Real Money Spends in the game.</p>
<p>The first image shows you what your tech center looks like. The
second image shows you the research tech domains you can access (at
varying levels).</p>
<p><img src="Images/Tech%20Centers.png"
style="width:25.0%" /> <img
src="Images/Tech%20Research%20Paths.png"
style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<p>When you click on the Alliance Duel domain (VS icon), you will see
many options that give bonuses to the tasks we need to perform each week
to earn VS points. I am highlighting the Radar tech in the top left
corner. Mine happens to be fully completed. This means that on days when
radar tasks give VS points, mine give 150% percent of the base points
(100% base + 50% buff). In other words, each radar task I complete
increases my/our VS Duel points by 25,000. So a member with a lower
research level is doing the same thing I am but is getting a fraction of
the points for it.</p>
<p><img
src="Images/Alliance%20Duel%20Research%20Path.png"
style="width:20.0%" /> <img
src="Images/VS%20Tech%20Icons.png"
style="width:20.0%" /> <br></p>
<p><img
src="Images/Focused%20Radar%20Upgrade.jpg"
style="width:30.0%" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve completed an upgrade, you will always get the higher
points in each week’s Alliance Duel.You will see that there are buffs
for nearly everything we do that earns Alliance Duel points. This is the
first and most important step you can take to improving your
contributions to the Alliance Duel.</p>
<div id="day-3-age-of-science" class="section level3">
<h3>Day 3: Age of Science</h3>
<p><br> <em>Alliance Duel Victory Value: 2 Points</em> <br></p>
<p><img
src="Images/Age%20of%20Science%20Details.PNG"
style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<p><strong>Day 3 Explained</strong></p>
<p>Day 3 (Age of Science) Rewards VS points for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech Center Research
<ul>
<li>Completing Research</li>
<li>Using Research Speedups</li>
<li>Using Valor Badges</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increasing Tech Power (which comes from completing research)</li>
<li>Completing Radar Tasks</li>
<li>Opening Drone Compenent Chests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prioritizing</strong></p>
<p><em>Upgrades with Valor Badges</em></p>
<p>The way to earn the most VS points on Day 3 is by upgrading tech that
requires the use of valor badges, which can be viewed in your
inventory’s “Special” tab and look like this:</p>
<p><img src="Images/Valor%20Badges.png"
style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<p>There are multiple ways to acquire valor badges, but that doesn’t
make them easy to get. You likely won’t be able to upgrade ever
valor-badge tech you want each time it’s the Age of Science. You simply
will run out of those before you run out of speedups and gold.</p>
<p>The following tech domains require valor badges for upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Alliance Duel</p></li>
<li><p>Special Forces</p></li>
<li><p>Intercity Truck</p></li>
<li><p>Siege to Seize</p></li>
<li><p>Defense Fortifications</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Radar Tasks</em></p>
<p>This can be a huge and easy source of points. But this is mostly true
when you have maxed out the radar boost in the Alliance Duel Tech domain
in the research center. I am <strong>extremely</strong> reluctant to
tell people how to spend their money, but I do not advise paying the
$4.99 for a radar replinsh. It can purchase 1,000,000 VS points when you
are fully upgraded, but this is typically nowhere near enough to flip
the outcome of the day. What’s more, you have basically nothing to show
for your money. The benefit is almost immediately gone.</p>
<p><em>Drone Component Chests</em></p>
<p>The hardest part about getting points opening drone component chests
is just waiting 6 days to spend them each week as Day 3 is the only time
you get VS points for them. The very high level chests can boost your
score very quickly, but those are extremely difficult to obtain. As I
said before, the best thing you can do is keep staring at the image
below six days and not touching them.</p>
<p><img
src="Images/Drone%20Component%20Chests.png"
style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<p><strong>Maximizing with the Secretary of Science Buff</strong></p>
<p>Most of the time (I won’t go into the exceptions here), you can apply
at the capital for the Secretary of Science (and other) position. The
server’s First Lady appoints people to this position once they have
applied. Generally, when it is your turn, you will have the Secretay of
Science position for 5 minutes only. During this time, you will get a
50% reduction in research time added to your existing buffs. This means
it doesn’t cut the time you see in half. It’s more complicated than
that. Nevertheless, it can take DAYS (yes, days!) off of your time for
research at the higher levels.</p>
<p>To apply for Secretary of Science Position, you can click the
“Capital” crown icon that is sometimes visible on the right hand side of
your screen. When that icon is not there, you need to go to your
profile, select the server (421), and then select the “Officials”
(building) icon.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Capital%20Icon.png"
style="width:15.0%" /> <img
src="Images/Secretary%20of%20Science.png"
style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p><img src="Images/Capital%20Officials.png"
style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>Make sure that you plan ahead. The wait list is usually very long.
Each person in line is a minimum 5 minute wait. Count how many are ahead
of you, multiply by 5, and then set an alarm for close to the time when
you should be up. Keep in mind that some First Lady’s skip over folks in
the quere who are not online. So it’s possible that you will get skipped
if you sign off. Getting this buff can be a serious committment on Day 3
of VS, but it’s definitely worth it.</p>
<p>Once the buff is active, choose small research tasks (in terms of
time). Start the task and then burn through all of the research speedups
I know you’ve been saving. Complete as many research levels as possible,
focusing on those that use Valor Badges. Watch your point total
skyrocket while you get super strong.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: The Secretary of Science position also gives you a 25% boost
to building construction time reduction, so you can double dip.
Similarly, the Secretary of Development Position gives you a 25%
research boost in addition to the 50% construction boost. So if you
don’t feel like waiting in line for Secretary of Science, you can
usually get the Development position faster and sacrifice some
times.</p>

<div id="rotating-events" class="section level1">
<h1>Rotating Events</h1>
<p>Last War features a number of events that rotate throughout the
month. I’ll try to get them all here eventually.</p>
<div id="zombie-invasion"
class="section level2 tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">
<h2 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">Zombie Invasion</h2>
<p><img
src="Images/Zombie%20Invasion%20Menu.png" /></p>
<p>I like to refer to Zombie Invasion as “The Most Wonderful Time of the
Year.” What’s not to love about Zombie Invasion? Little leprechaumbies
that crap out big fat Zombie Bosses when you kill them? Sweet (and I
mean <em>sweet</em>) rewards. In fact, that’s where I’ll start.</p>
<div id="zombie-invasion-mechanics" class="section level3">
<h3>Zombie Invasion Mechanics</h3>
<p>This event is straightforward. The server map populates with
delicious little level 10 zombies holding pots of gold (henceforward
known as leprechaumbies). The leprechaumbies are easy to kill and they
give great rewards.</p>
<p>Occasionally, defeating a leprechaumbie causes them to poop at a
zombie boss. These are like doom elites (standard, not Season 1) in that
you must rally attack them regardless of levels. The levels increase at
multiples of 5, so don’t go looking for a level 3 one. These bosses are
unlike regular doom elites in that, at higher levels, they can be really
annoying to kill, making them tough little fitches (get it?
<strong>leprechaumbie and fitch</strong>?). And the difference in
rewards between something like a level 45 and a level 65 is in no way
worth the loss of troops.</p>
<p>Another cool way that these zombie bosses differ from regualar doom
elites is that the person who killed the leprechaumbie that pooped out
the fitch gets a “finders fee” when someone kills that fitch. So you get
rewards even if you don’t kill it. Of course, the catch is that they are
on a timer, so you have to kill them in a set amount of time.</p>
<p>And if this all isn’t enough, let me put a cherry on top of this
Sunday. If you kill the fitch that your spawned you basically get double
rewards.</p>
<p>What I like to do, since the leprechaumbies are so easy to kill, is
to go tile surf (see other tab) and farm with my lower squad so that my
top squad is free to launch the rally on any fitches I spawn.</p>
<p><img src="Images/LepandFitch.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="zombie-invasion-store" class="section level3 active">
<h3 class="active">Zombie Invasion Store</h3>
<p><img src="Images/Trade%20Store.png"
style="width:25.0%" /> <br></p>
<p>In theory the most important part of Zombie Invasion is how to
participate. But you’d be amazed how many people participate in Zombie
Invasion for months and have no idea there is a ZOMBIE INVASION STORE!!!
And it’s actually really good. Here’s what you need to know.</p>
<p>Killing Leprechaumbies (level 10 normies) and Fitches (the spawning
zombie bosses) gives you trade store tickets. These can be spent in the
Zombie Invasion Trade Store <strong>as long as the event is currently
live</strong>. But don’t worry, if you don’t manage to spend all of your
tickets, they’ll stay in your inventory until the next time the event is
back in rotation.</p>
<p>I don’t have tons of advice about prioritizing purchases except to
say that my first choice here is always the stamina. Each Leprezaumbie
uses 10 stamina and the zombie bosses require 20. You can run out of
stamina <strong>real fast</strong> farming these lovelies. So stock up
here first.</p>
<p>From there, I typically prioritize hero recruitment tickets. Beyond
that, it really just depends on your needs at the time.</p>
<p>I typically don’t buy valor points or drone parts here because I
don’t think they are better buys than the other stuff in the store and I
never have enough tickets to buy everything.</p>
</div>
<div id="tile-surfing-for-faster-zombie-farming" class="section level3">
<h3>Tile Surfing for Faster Zombie Farming</h3>
<p>The game mechanics set different marching speeds for your squads
based on the activity they are doing. In general, it takes a LOT longer
to get somewhere when you are attacking. It takes about hald the time to
travel to an adjacent resource tile, though, because the march speed for
gathering is so much faster. In other words, if there is a zombie right
next to a gold mine on the map, and you dispatch two squads at the same,
assuming they have equal base march speeds, the squad going to the gold
mine will get to it’s destination almost twice as fast as the one that
you dispatched to the zombie.</p>
<p>So the smart play if you want to attack the zombie is to dispatch
your squad to the gold mine, then attack the zombie from the gold mine
once you are there or right before you get to your location.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take it to the next level for maximum efficiency. There
are so many gold-pot-toting zombies on the map that you can spend lots
of time hunting them. The real pro move for this is what I call “tile
surfing”. The idea is that you find an area with lots of the little
zombies, target a nearby resource tile, transition to the zombie, then
rinse and repeat.</p>

</div>
<div id="paying-to-win" class="section level1">
<h1>Paying to Win</h1>
<p>Like it not, this game is pay to win. It’s not pay to play, but if
you want to achieve max bonuses, unlock the best gear, grab those
amazing cosmetics, and defeat your opponents, the amount you spend
matters. In our alliance (#421; lfG), I make a big deal not to pressure
people to spend real money. In fact, our leadership team has been
instructed not even to suggest people spend money on this game. But I
have invested plenty of money in this game, and there are <em>lots</em>
of people who have invested thousands of REAL US DOLLARS in this game.
It’s a serious business.</p>
<p>Many people think the idea that spending any money at all on a free
game is absurd. People are allowed to feel however they want. But let me
offer some of my perspective on this. I used to run a lot. I got to
where I got sad if I wasn’t running 4-8 miles a day. One thing that’s
awesome about running is that you can do it for free. However, you can
also spend hundreds of dollars on high-performance shoes. You can add
hundreds more in fancy attire and supplements. You can even pay money to
run at the same time as other people in a thing called a race, which is
wild, because you can basically challenge anyone to a foot race for the
price of zero dollars.</p>
<p>I have a buddy who is big into golfing. He tells me that depending on
the course, a person could expect to pay a median greens fee in the
range of $50 - $100 for 18 holes. Now let’s say my buddy does that this
Friday. He drops $100 on 18 holes and 2 rounds of beers and has 4 hours
of fun on a Friday afternoon. When that’s over, he’s got nothing to show
for it. But who cares? He works hard for his money and had a good time
when he spent it.</p>
<p>I see the game the same way. If I play this game for 4 hours on
Friday night and have a blast pushing VS, doing Desert Storm, rallying
Marshall and lighting up HQs in Enemy Buster, and chatting with all my
friends in the alliance who are doing the same, who cares if I spent $50
on game packs? I had a blast, and the $50 helped me win some of those
close battles. I have just as much to show for it as my buddy who played
a round of golf.</p>
<p>My final take is this: I work for a living. I make money for my work.
I have played this game for multiple hours probably every day since I
downloaded it. That’s hundreds of hours of enjoyment. Some people spend
$100 a month just on tipping the barista who pours their iced coffee
each morning. The absurdity of tipping as a system of payment is a
conversation for another blog. But I think the Devs of this game do a
lot more work to ensure my enjoyment than the myriad folks nowadays who
flip the iPad and tell me there’s a question I need to answer. And I
think the devs deserve to make money for that work. So I’m not going to
feel bad buying game packs to support them. Just like with my server at
the restaurant, it’s not their fault they make more money if I spend
more and tip better.</p>
<p>In sum, you work hard for your money and if you can afford to spend
some on this game, then that’s your business. If you don’t want to spend
any money, that’s cool, too. This is a free game. There are many people
in this game who have really powerful accounts and have spent $0 or a
couple of bucks at most. You just have to grind it out and be smart.
That’s what this strategy guide is for. If you want to spend money,
though, there are also smart ways to do it. I’m going to give you my top
5 in-game spends here as well as some pay-to-win grabs that I think you
might want to avoid.</p>
<div id="top-5-in-game-purchases" class="section level2">
<h2>Top 5 In-Game purchases</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Construction Queue 2 for $1.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/2ndbuilder.png"
style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>Think of this as purchasing time. You don’t have to wait nearly as
long in real life to enjoy new parts of the game if you build multiple
buildings at once. To put it another way, this is like paying $2 for a
permanent 50% construction buff (you’re doing twice the building now in
the same amount of time as a single). There is a way to “rent” the
second building queue for diamonds when you need it. That’s a great
option for free-to-play people, but I think $2 here is money very well
spent. And think of it like this. Since you no longer have to rent the
builder with diamonds, you’re essentially purchasing a boat load of
future diamonds with that $2. I mean who doesn’t love a good BOGO!?</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Second Tech Center for $9.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/2ndtech.png"
style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>When you get into later game (like HQ27 and up), the emphasis shifts
drastically to upgrading your tech. There are SOOOOOO many tech upgrades
and they start getting into taking multiple weeks to finish. You really
can’t compete at the highest levels if you don’t have a lot of upgrades.
And you can technically upgrade everything in the game with one tech
center, but man does it take forever. A second tech center can also add
some extra oomph to VS and Arms Race events that reward tech power
increases.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Kimberly (UR Tank Hero) for $.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/Kim99.webp"
style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>This list used to have 1a as the second construction queue and 1b as
Kim. She’s fallen a little bit recently because the game no longer
forces you to upgrade the tank center in order to get to higher HQ
levels. Nevertheless, Kim remains pound-for-pound the best hero purchase
in the game. There are other UR heroes that are comparable (Stetman in
particular), but you typically have to spend $5 on the “Take All” daily
sale to unlock him (See number 5 for more info about Daily Must
Buys).</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Construction Queue 3 for $9.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/3rd%20builder.PNG"
style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>This is nowhere near the steal that the second construction queue is,
but it’s still a tremendous value. Hero power is great, but I think the
best purchases in the game are the ones that save you time. Even with
multiple stacked construction buffs and the appointment to Secretary of
Development, high level HQ upgrades can take a month or more. And the
tech center, tank (or missile or aircraft) centers, barracks, hospitals
and the wall aren’t far behind. Only having one or even two constuction
queues will get you bottlenecked for growth in the long run.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>“Take All” Daily Must Buy for $4.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/Daily%20Must%20Buy.PNG"
style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>The Daily Must Buy “Take All” deal is great. Every day you get a
chance to get 10 hero-specific UR shards and some other assorted rewards
for $4.99. This is how I have unlocked multiple UR heroes. You can
unlock some by random chance with legendary recruitment tickets, but
these offers are the fastest and most efficient way to do so. I never
buy the individual packages for a legend, btw. I always buy the “Take
All” deal. And you can always click the arrows icon to change which hero
you’re buying.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honorable Mention: Survivor Taylor for $4.99</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This one might surprise you. But when you pay $4.99 to unlock Taylor,
she immediately gets to work. You’ll deploy her to your headquarters and
every day from then on out, you’ll get 5 adventurer Taylor chests (1
with each of your first 5 daily radar scans). Early on, these can have a
UR Decoration to put in your base, though the odds of landing one seem
to frop dramatically after the first level or two. But every day I get
my five free chests.</p>

<h2>Purchases I Advise Against</h2>
<p>Look, you’re free to spend your money how you like. It’s not my
business to tell what to buy and what not to buy. Instead, let’s just
say these are purchases in the game that I personally feel have very
little value.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Radar Replenish for $4.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This little bastard gets people all the time. It’s super tempting
because for the the low price of 5 dollars you can basically buy 1
Million vs points (assuming you’ve maxed out the tech center boost for
radar scans) with the possibility of getting a dig.</p>
<p>In general, though, I don’t like purchases like these that do not
have staying power. In other words, unlike a hero purchase that I get to
keep as long as I play the game, a radar replenish has no value 30
seconds after you finish the scans. You may have gotten a few treasure
chests and some VS points, but you can’t really point to something like
a new hero of second building queue that you have to show for your
money. As such, it’s my number one buy to avoid.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Diamond Packs for multiple amounts</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Say what you want about the greedy devs trying to stick their hands
in your Apple wallet, these folks hand out premium in-game currency all
the time. Most pay-to-win games are super stingy with premium currency,
but you can easily rack up thousands of diamonds a day without buying a
single one. And every time the devs think an update may have hurt
someone’s feelings that send you 100 diamonds in your System Mail inbox.
With so many chances to get these resources for free, I’m a hard pass on
recommending folks spend any real money on them.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Pure Random Draws</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t have a great example in my head, but some of the items you
can purchase work off a random roll of some digital dice. I don’t like
it. If you want to gamble, go somehwere they serve free drinks on the
floor. I’ve only bought game packs in one special events mode and that
was sportsopoly and only because it was an unusually cheap way to get
legendary gear blueprints. And there were counters and mechanics that
rewarded you for each purchase despite the presence of a random game
mechanic. But if I see a purchase option and’s totally independent
draws, I steer clear.</p>
