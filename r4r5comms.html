<div id="family-matters" class="section level1">
<h1>Family Matters</h1>
<p>Mia LFG Famiglia,</p>
<p>When I launched this blog I was announcing the launch of our new
identity of LFG. It was a melding of Let’s *$&amp;@!^ Go and the Italian
word for family. It was meant to express the two core parts of what I
wanted our identity to be.</p>
<p>It is time to revisit this conversation.</p>
<p>We are half a year into life as LFG and something realities have
emerged that have given rise to the need for some difficult
conversations and descisions.</p>
<p>First, let me be clear that Family before Famiglia will always be our
core principal. But we need to clarify what that means. Family before
Famiglia means that your real-life (IRL family, friends, and work)
<em>responsibilities</em> will always be respected above any
expectations for the game.</p>
<p>We need to have some serious talk, though, about the difference
between real-life responsibilities and real-life choices and
preferences. For some of us, this is a competitive game. I am not
athletic (and I’m old and fat now), so I don’t play rec league
basketball or church league softball. This game is my rec league. And I
like being the player-coach. And I like being competitive about it. And
there are about 20-30 other LFG members who <em>behave</em> the same.
But the overwhelming majority of the alliance doesn’t participate at the
same level. The hard truth is that it is holding us back in some ways
and making it harder in others. It’s time we address this.</p>
<div id="actives-and-passives" class="section level2">
<h2>Actives and Passives</h2>
<p>Since the launch, we have focused so much on the LFG side of things
and on being a family. But we aren’t LFG: The Family. We are LFG: <em>La
Famiglia</em>. If you’ll pardon the inappropriate stereotype, you need
to think of our family less like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver">the Cleavers</a>
and more like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corleone_family">the
Corleones</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, the R4s and I-along with about 20-30 of the rest of
you-treat LFG like a family business. We are committed to it. We put
time (and money for some of us) into this game. We play constantly or
off and on throughout the day. We log in for almost all of the events.
We are active in the chats. We are responsive. We read announcements and
do what they say.</p>
<p>We also carry and protect many of you through major events. And
whether you understand it or not, even our most passive players receive
benefits that make their casual gameplay better. Here’s an example.</p>
<p>I recently posted a screenshot of my progress on researching the tech
for level 10 (T10) troops. The final 4 research techs all will cost me
more than half a BILLION gold each. And I have spent BILLIONS and
BILLIONS of gold on the ones before those.</p>
<p>Now I want you to look at the Alliance Tech. We just finished the
Level 10 Senior Scientist, which makes all research cost 5% less. Now,
5% may not sound like a lot, but 5% of 500 million gold is 25 million.
As far as I know, only a handful of us are close to completing the T10
research, but we got here without that same discount. But if you haven’t
started yet, then when you do it, it will cost you probably several
hundred million less gold than it cost me and the others.</p>
<p>That discount was bought with alliance tech donations that probably
came from the most active people in the alliance. But you get the buff,
along with dozens others. And don’t forget about the cities and dig
sites we have captured this season. Look at the image here and see how
many seasonal buffs you get right now just by having LFGo as part of
your account. Now many of you have helped with the capturing of these
cities. But most of you don’t.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a-family-business-or-a-family-dinner" class="section level1">
<h1>A Family Business or A Family Dinner</h1>
<p>We are a family here. But we are going to start making some
distinctions. Some of you are part of the family business, you’re
members of our organized crime syndicate. You put in the work day in and
day out. But some (maybe most) of LFG just comes for family dinner and
lets the rest of us feed them.</p>
<p>That being said, we aren’t going to start booting anyone (for now).
There are two reasons why.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You are still family, whether you are active or not. That means
something to me. I know that some of you have special circumstances that
make it hard for you to play regularly or as much as the upper 30% of
actives.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s no real benefit to booting family members who show up
just to eat dinner. There’s not a long line of people in the server just
waiting for their chance to join.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="moving-people-off-the-payroll" class="section level2">
<h2>Moving people off the payroll</h2>
<p>The hard truth is that something needs to be done. Soon the R4s and I
will start demoting many of you to R1 status. Moving forward, this means
that you will have a safe space here. You will be protected and you will
still get our buffs. But here’s the other side of that.</p>
<ul>
<li>No one in LFG will be expected to carry you through monsters (First
Blood Doom Walkers that are way too strong for you) or events (like
General’s Trial) that are way too difficult.</li>
<li>We will ask that everyone prioritize assisting Ghost Ops and Secret
tasks that belong to R2-R5. It is not ok for someone who logs in and
participates regularly to miss out on a UR ghost ops task because one of
our more rare 4-star heroes (<em>e.g.</em>, Lucius or Adam) is tied up
on a ghost op for someone who logs in once a day and rarely
participates. It also bothers me when I see UR tasks from committed
members at risk of being plundered and no one has assists left because
they used them on people who are not active.</li>
<li>If Enemy Buster is not important for a weekly victory, we will not
reinforce your base when you don’t shield. We won’t be burning troops
for our active members to try and protect our most casual people.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tough-love" class="section level2">
<h2>Tough Love</h2>
<p>Fam, I love you all. I have prayed for many of you. Sent gift cards
to some of you when tough things have happened in your life. I have
given my personal cell number out to multiples of you. I have spent
hours of my life-outside of playing this game-lobbying in Discord for
things that will help you enjoy the game better when you log in. At the
same time, I have been and continue to be asked by some of the bigger
alliances if I want to join them. I could be getting way better rewards
and growing my account far faster and for a lot fewer US dollars
elsewhere. But I love what we’ve built here. I am committed to La
FamiGlia. I have thrown a lot of time and energy and money into growing
my account so I can better protect each of you. So have many others in
LFG. But there is an expectation that you are also committed to the
family. We can be a family of takers and givers, but I don’t want that
to be who we are.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about your position in all of this, just reach
out to me or another R4. We don’t have a timeline yet for this, but it
will likely begin either the first of the year or after season 2
ends.</p>
<p>I know the holidays are still in full swing. I’m not changing my
position that says expectations will be relaxed. But many of the less
active folks aren’t less active than they normally are right now. They
are as they have always been. We know who these folks are. And the ones
who are unusually busy have reached out for the most part.</p>
<p>I hope that you are reading this and rather than feeling worried, you
are stirred up a bit to either continue your current high level activity
or feel encouraged to step it up.</p>
<p>Either way…</p>
<p>Let’s Freaking Get after it!</p>

<div id="setting-priorities-and-being-careful-in-server-422"
class="section level2">
<h2>Setting Priorities and Being Careful in Server 422</h2>
<p>Hey team,</p>
<p>I’ve got some homework for you. Please go to Server 422 and look at
who has the big cities and who is near us. We need some clarity on the
alliances. I can tell from recognition that there are a lot of powerful
alliances there and only one (#425 HIT) is friendly to our server; at
least it’s the only one that I’m aware of.</p>
<p>We need to be extremely careful. It’s one thing to have some fun and
rumble here in #422. It’s quite another thing for us to piss off some
big kids and bring the fight back to #421. Speaking of trouble in #421,
we may have a mess on our hands with EOK. The Gherkin informs me that
they have their sights set on our territories for reasons unknown to
me.</p>
<p>I have said this from the beginning of the season: Our first priority
to is to the long-term advancement of LFG in the server. We will not
risk that for more growth in 422 or elsewhere.</p>
<p>If I say we are doing to much, then let that be the end of it. Going
forward, we make no moves in other servers until 9:00 p.m. Eastern. We
will be saving all our caps for the end of the today in case we need to
box someone out. I have asked NSE to work with Damon (PCO) and Rick to
help coordinate some strategies for playing tile chess in 421 and trying
to restrict the advancement of EOK. We will make this the focus of our
main efforts. Please make a github account if you don’t have one already
so you can share whatever you learn about the other alliances as a
comment here. You can use <a
href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">Markdown</a> if you
want.</p>

<div id="map-advancement" class="section level2">
<h2>Map Advancement</h2>
<p>Hey team, I want to clear something up that I said yesterday. NSE and
I have had a few calls this week about the map advancement plans. There
are a few reasons it has been him and not the rest of you. I want to
explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>This planning is too much to do via chatting. I need to be able to
have this conversation as a voice call.</li>
<li>NSE knows the map very well AND he knows some of the other R5s since
he himself has been and is still the R5 of U5A. This means I can farm
out some interactions with folks without extra introductions.</li>
<li>This probably doesn’t Make Ntiva, Liz, and Kirsta feel any better,
but the reality is that I am able to keep my marriage much less
stressful by having a 45 minute voicecall with a dude from the game I
spend hours on than with a woman from the game I spend hours on.</li>
<li>The calls that NSE and I are having aren’t really much about
strategy as they are about time and making sure we are all talking about
the same map pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t want you all to feel like NSE is helping me plot out the
destiny of our territories and you all are shut out. While it’s true
that you all are shut out from strategizing and decision making, the
reality is that NSE and I are, too. The end state of the #421 map for
season 1 isn’t up for negotiation. Not with us at least. The top 3 have
divvied it up and are in talks with some other alliances that, though
smaller in alliance power, have some top players that could ash every
one of us. The top 3 alliances are giving preference to #421 alliances
that can help defend the higher level cities from invading servers. Like
it or not that’s not us.</p>
<p>So here’s where that leave us. The end state of the map is set. The
problem is that game mechanics prevent the top alliances from just going
ahead and taking them now. In order to get to the end state, the other
alliances are having to go <em>through</em> our proposed territory. And
because it takes days and weeks for the manors bell towers and shrines
to open for capture, we are going to be prevented from taking our full
space while they wait.</p>
<p>On top of that, we aren’t the only alliance in this situation. You
have no doubt noticed PCO to our east. They originally were not supposed
to be there. However, LKM (one of the contenders for the 5 spot) decided
to live where PCO was supposed to go. PCO then moved over by PAL. Now
PAL is displacing them like BWB is displacing us. You’ve also probably
noticed that PCO and LFG are being squeezed into the same area of the
map. PCO folks are good people. They are super pissed with the top 3
alliances right now and I’m trying to keep us out of the middle even
though we probably feel the same.</p>
<p>Mind you, these conversations are happening constantly these days.
Everyone is confused. It’s getting to the point where we are about to
stop planning stronghold and city takeovers in advance. Instead, as soon
as we <em>think</em> we have “confirmation” about a tile we can take, we
will begin the procces, try to communicate it to the alliance, and then
we will just go for it. If someone is on and can participate, then cool.
If not, then I hate it, but that’s not another viable way forward. And
if there is, I honestly don’t have much time or patience left to work it
out.</p>
<p>There will be some urgency moving forward because other alliances are
trying to kill the stronghold guardians to farm the professional
expertise. One guy from BWB reached out and asked if I minded the other
day and was cool when I told him that I did in fact mind. But other
folks are just attacking whatever they want. There’s frankly not much we
can do about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, Pickle sent the R5s a copy of the current (as of last night
at least) end state map. Here’s what it looks like. I added the LFG and
it’s not 100% accurate, but it conveys the general area. TBD is “too be
determined” and not some new surprise alliance. I know you know what TBD
means. I just saying that because I thought it might look confusing
since it looks like an alliance tag.</p>

<div id="good-cop-bad-cop-mall-cop" class="section level2">
<h2><em>Good Cop / Bad Cop / Mall Cop</em></h2>
<p>Hey team. I’m not linking to this website on the blog. This is going
to be a place I can send longer communications to you.</p>
<p>I’m not upset like I was the other night. I won’t rehash the
play-by-play. Instead I’ll just say a few high-level things about the
road forward.</p>
<p>First I’ll be blunt. There is only one R5 and it’s me. I have access
to conversations that you don’t have access to that include people who
have spent thousands of dollars on this game and have zero interest in
our feelings about fairness. I barely have time to have all of those
conversations with them. I definitely don’t have time to share
everything that was said.</p>
<p>In lots of cases things are chagning by the minute and it’s becoming
more and more clear that even though Pickle is in our alliance, LFG is
still relatively weak. Pickle isn’t in a fun position. I think he likes
us fine, but there are 15 alliances that bitch at him constantly. I can
imagine that he probably gets to a point where he feels like he’s
thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours into this game and he doesn’t
want to hear us arguing with him about what we deserve or have earned.
Server Wars are coming. And if you think we have big boys and girls in
421, you’re not looking at the menus enough. There are people who have
spent zero dollars in this pay-to-win game and get bent out of shape
when a big alliance tells them what to do. Imagine how you’d feel if you
were 10 grand into this game and a literal millionaire in another server
turns your HQ into their personal farm.</p>
<p>That’s an actual possibility and fear for these folks at the top of
our alliance.</p>
<p>I’ve made significant investments of time building this alliance
since I became leader, doing stuff that can’t really be delegated and
can’t usually wait. Just since yesterday I’ve spent 2 hours on the phone
with NSE trying to sort out a plan for the map conquest only to be told
by the top 3 alliances that we have to change our plans. It’s annoying
as hell. But it’s also annoying when I use the 5 minutes I’ve got left
before I have to handle my real-life stuff to post the revised
hot-off-the-presses plan only to be greeted by pushback in the R4
chat.</p>
<p>I have already solicited more feedback and given in on more things
that I didn’t want to since we merged than I think Nic did the entire
time I was an R4 in PAO. I’m absolutely not interested in “my way or the
highway” leadership culture. But right now it’s got to be a little bit
of that just because there’s too much going on all the time for us to
have consensus building on everything. Please believe me that we are all
of the same opinion that we should grow stronger and have fun. Let’s not
argue right now over the optimal takeover strategy and event timing to
get there.</p>
<p>Going forward, I need you to trust me. I won’t have time or
inclination to explain everything. At least not in the chat or even in
discord. When things get crazy and need explaining, I’ll try to update
you all here when I have time. But there’s got to be less bickering with
me and pushing back.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll update this page with a map from Pickle that shows how
the final Season 1 positions will look. It’s not going to be fun getting
to that shape. The game mechanics limit expansion tremendously. The top
5 are going to move through our intended space and wait on their final
pieces to open up. We have a lot of annoying waiting ahead. The good
news is that we will get to focus on growing and the normal stuff we all
love, like Marshall and Zombie Siege.</p>
<p>More to come tomorrow. Remember, I appreciate you all deeply and am
taking it on the chin out there in the DMs and discord to make sure we
get to be in a position to continue to flourish and enjoy the game.
Please hang in there with me.</p>
<p>-Jeff</p>
