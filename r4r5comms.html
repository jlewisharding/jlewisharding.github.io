<h2>Season 1 Server Wars</h2>
<p>Hey team,</p>
<p>My guess is that at this point each of you knows more about server
wars in Season 1 than I do. That being said, I want to propose a course
and get your feedback.</p>

<h2>Map Advancement</h2>
<p>Hey team, I want to clear something up that I said yesterday. NSE and
I have had a few calls this week about the map advancement plans. There
are a few reasons it has been him and not the rest of you. I want to
explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>This planning is too much to do via chatting. I need to be able to
have this conversation as a voice call.</li>
<li>NSE knows the map very well AND he knows some of the other R5s since
he himself has been and is still the R5 of U5A. This means I can farm
out some interactions with folks without extra introductions.</li>
<li>This probably doesn’t Make Ntiva, Liz, and Kirsta feel any better,
but the reality is that I am able to keep my marriage much less
stressful by having a 45 minute voicecall with a dude from the game I
spend hours on than with a woman from the game I spend hours on.</li>
<li>The calls that NSE and I are having aren’t really much about
strategy as they are about time and making sure we are all talking about
the same map pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t want you all to feel like NSE is helping me plot out the
destiny of our territories and you all are shut out. While it’s true
that you all are shut out from strategizing and decision making, the
reality is that NSE and I are, too. The end state of the #421 map for
season 1 isn’t up for negotiation. Not with us at least. The top 3 have
divvied it up and are in talks with some other alliances that, though
smaller in alliance power, have some top players that could ash every
one of us. The top 3 alliances are giving preference to #421 alliances
that can help defend the higher level cities from invading servers. Like
it or not that’s not us.</p>
<p>So here’s where that leave us. The end state of the map is set. The
problem is that game mechanics prevent the top alliances from just going
ahead and taking them now. In order to get to the end state, the other
alliances are having to go <em>through</em> our proposed territory. And
because it takes days and weeks for the manors bell towers and shrines
to open for capture, we are going to be prevented from taking our full
space while they wait.</p>
<p>On top of that, we aren’t the only alliance in this situation. You
have no doubt noticed PCO to our east. They originally were not supposed
to be there. However, LKM (one of the contenders for the 5 spot) decided
to live where PCO was supposed to go. PCO then moved over by PAL. Now
PAL is displacing them like BWB is displacing us. You’ve also probably
noticed that PCO and LFG are being squeezed into the same area of the
map. PCO folks are good people. They are super pissed with the top 3
alliances right now and I’m trying to keep us out of the middle even
though we probably feel the same.</p>
<p>Mind you, these conversations are happening constantly these days.
Everyone is confused. It’s getting to the point where we are about to
stop planning stronghold and city takeovers in advance. Instead, as soon
as we <em>think</em> we have “confirmation” about a tile we can take, we
will begin the procces, try to communicate it to the alliance, and then
we will just go for it. If someone is on and can participate, then cool.
If not, then I hate it, but that’s not another viable way forward. And
if there is, I honestly don’t have much time or patience left to work it
out.</p>
<p>There will be some urgency moving forward because other alliances are
trying to kill the stronghold guardians to farm the professional
expertise. One guy from BWB reached out and asked if I minded the other
day and was cool when I told him that I did in fact mind. But other
folks are just attacking whatever they want. There’s frankly not much we
can do about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, Pickle sent the R5s a copy of the current (as of last night
at least) end state map. Here’s what it looks like. I added the LFG and
it’s not 100% accurate, but it conveys the general area. TBD is “too be
determined” and not some new surprise alliance. I know you know what TBD
means. I just saying that because I thought it might look confusing
since it looks like an alliance tag.</p>

<div id="good-cop-bad-cop-mall-cop" class="section level2">
<h2><em>Good Cop / Bad Cop / Mall Cop</em></h2>
<p>Hey team. I’m not linking to this website on the blog. This is going
to be a place I can send longer communications to you.</p>
<p>I’m not upset like I was the other night. I won’t rehash the
play-by-play. Instead I’ll just say a few high-level things about the
road forward.</p>
<p>First I’ll be blunt. There is only one R5 and it’s me. I have access
to conversations that you don’t have access to that include people who
have spent thousands of dollars on this game and have zero interest in
our feelings about fairness. I barely have time to have all of those
conversations with them. I definitely don’t have time to share
everything that was said.</p>
<p>In lots of cases things are chagning by the minute and it’s becoming
more and more clear that even though Pickle is in our alliance, LFG is
still relatively weak. Pickle isn’t in a fun position. I think he likes
us fine, but there are 15 alliances that bitch at him constantly. I can
imagine that he probably gets to a point where he feels like he’s
thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours into this game and he doesn’t
want to hear us arguing with him about what we deserve or have earned.
Server Wars are coming. And if you think we have big boys and girls in
421, you’re not looking at the menus enough. There are people who have
spent zero dollars in this pay-to-win game and get bent out of shape
when a big alliance tells them what to do. Imagine how you’d feel if you
were 10 grand into this game and a literal millionaire in another server
turns your HQ into their personal farm.</p>
<p>That’s an actual possibility and fear for these folks at the top of
our alliance.</p>
<p>I’ve made significant investments of time building this alliance
since I became leader, doing stuff that can’t really be delegated and
can’t usually wait. Just since yesterday I’ve spent 2 hours on the phone
with NSE trying to sort out a plan for the map conquest only to be told
by the top 3 alliances that we have to change our plans. It’s annoying
as hell. But it’s also annoying when I use the 5 minutes I’ve got left
before I have to handle my real-life stuff to post the revised
hot-off-the-presses plan only to be greeted by pushback in the R4
chat.</p>
<p>I have already solicited more feedback and given in on more things
that I didn’t want to since we merged than I think Nic did the entire
time I was an R4 in PAO. I’m absolutely not interested in “my way or the
highway” leadership culture. But right now it’s got to be a little bit
of that just because there’s too much going on all the time for us to
have consensus building on everything. Please believe me that we are all
of the same opinion that we should grow stronger and have fun. Let’s not
argue right now over the optimal takeover strategy and event timing to
get there.</p>
<p>Going forward, I need you to trust me. I won’t have time or
inclination to explain everything. At least not in the chat or even in
discord. When things get crazy and need explaining, I’ll try to update
you all here when I have time. But there’s got to be less bickering with
me and pushing back.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll update this page with a map from Pickle that shows how
the final Season 1 positions will look. It’s not going to be fun getting
to that shape. The game mechanics limit expansion tremendously. The top
5 are going to move through our intended space and wait on their final
pieces to open up. We have a lot of annoying waiting ahead. The good
news is that we will get to focus on growing and the normal stuff we all
love, like Marshall and Zombie Siege.</p>
<p>More to come tomorrow. Remember, I appreciate you all deeply and am
taking it on the chin out there in the DMs and discord to make sure we
get to be in a position to continue to flourish and enjoy the game.
Please hang in there with me.</p>
<p>-Jeff</p>
