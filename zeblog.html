<div id="the-blog-is-back" class="section level1">
<h1>The blog is back!</h1>
<p>Sorry this has taken me so long to fix. I had some website deployment
issues, but I should be in good shape now.</p>
<p>There’s been so much to cover that I haven’t been able to address.
And there is still so so much more. But rather than diving into details
right now about Level-Swap tickets and converting Mason to a UR hero,
I’m going to zoom way out and talk about game meta and the
macro-political influences of the larger game on your daily “life” in
LFG.</p>
<p>Many of you have been confused and probably felt jerked around by the
back and forth in communication. I apologize. There are many moving
parts to this season for the long-established alliances. They are
confused, too. I know they are because I’m talking to their leaders
across multiple media platforms.</p>
<p>If it’s all confusing for them, then consider that, in addition to
adjusting to the Season 1 changes, we are at the same time trying to
grow a new alliance. It’s all just so much. We’re still in the early
stages of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development">forming,
storming, norming, and performing</a> cycle of group/team growth and on
top of all that we’re learning an entirely new game meta for season
1.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to politics. The new map is huge, but it has <em>de
jure</em> rules for conquest. For example, you can’t take a level 2 town
until you hold a level 1 village. And you can only siege adjacent tiles.
There are more rules, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>In addition to those rules of conquest that the devs put in place,
there are also <em>de facto</em> rules of conquest we have to abide by
in the server. I previously talked to you all about the “haves” and the
“have nots” in the server. I mentioned we were fortunate to be the
“haves.” Well, it turns out we are “have nots.” And it’s the haves that
run the show, regardless of you feel about it.</p>
<p>What I mean is that I’m pretty sure my squad of around 16 million
power is the strongest in the alliance. It could be dashblue at the top,
but that dude is a silent colossus from the days or yore. Even with a
16M march power, I’m outgunned by multiple HQs in 5-6 other alliances
across the server. So even though we have a top-5 alliance power
ranking, it’s mostly because of our combined size. But that’s just not
enough to gain influence.</p>
<p>Think of it like this. We are kind of like Australia. We’ve got
plenty of people. We’ve got koalas and dingoes and basically 95% of the
most poisonous animals in the world. But box-jelly fish doesn’t beat
nuclear bomb in the expanded version of global rock-paper-scissors. And
when the US, China, and Russia decide something is going to happen,
Australia can whine, but they just have to deal with it.</p>
<p>That’s where we are. So when you are looking to me (and the R4s) for
clear and fast direction, know that I want to give it to you. I just
can’t. The top 3 or 4 alliances are carving up the map. They have some
arguably valid reasons why they are doing what they are doing that I’ll
explain some a bit later in the week.</p>
<p>You all may think this is absurd. “It’s a game,” you say. “Let
everyone get a piece of the action!” you shout. There’s truth in that.
But this is a game you choose to play. And it’s pay-to-win. Oh, and it’s
a game about war.</p>
<p>The politics and pay-to-win nature of the game aren’t going to
change. If you want to keep playing, and you want to have a seat at the
table, then you gotta grind for it. You gotta be smart with your moves
and maximize rewards. You need to log in every day and not waste
resources. Read the blog. Ask for tips. Google things you don’t know.
Listen to what I tell you and don’t argue. Trust that I’m privy to lots
of server-wide chatter that I don’t have time to share with
everyone.</p>
<p>We can be top 4. I truly believe it. We may not have the money of
other alliances, but we have something they can’t buy: family. They say
culture eats strategy (and spending) for breakfast. Let’s show them it’s
true.</p>
<p>You want to be at the top? Me too. <strong>Lets F$#@!^% Go</strong>

<h1 class="tabset tabset-pills">And so it begins</h1>
<p>Famiglia, there’s a lot going on. I hope this organization format
helps. Make sure you check out info on Season 1 stuff as well as regular
gameplay stuff like VS.</p>
<div id="season-1" class="section level2 tabset tabset-pills">
<h2 class="tabset tabset-pills">Season 1</h2>
<p>We’ve learned a lot in the last day. Here’s there skinny on what we
think you need to know to get started in Season 1. For now, we are only
focusing on your individual gameplay and not large-scale alliance and
server-wide gameplay.</p>
<p>Ok. There’s a virus. You need immunity. You get it from upgrading the
Virus Research Institute. You need Immune Protein to upgrade the Virus
Research Institute. The main way you get that is from farms. Check out
the Essential Resources tab for more on that.</p>
<p>Zombies are way tougher in Season 1. They are infected. So as their
levels get higher, you need more resistance. You get higher resistance
by building and upgrading the new Virus Research Academy.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Construction%20Icon.png"
style="width:35.0%" /> <img
src="Images/Farm%20and%20Institute.png"
style="width:35.0%" /></p>
<p>The Virus Research Institute and the Protein Farms are in the lowest
right section of your HQ, an area that was previously unoccupied.</p>
<div id="essential-resources" class="section level3">
<h3>Essential Resources</h3>
<p>There are two new currencies: Immmue Protein and Mutant Crystals. You
can get them from typical free in-game mechanics like defeating
monsters. You can also get through so seasonal tasks and
accomplishments. And, of course, you can buy them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immune Protein:</li>
</ul>
<p>The passive way to get Immune Protein (pickle juice) is from Protein
Farms. These are like other resource producing buildings in your HQ. You
can upgrade them using Mutant Crystals, the other new currency in Season
1.</p>
<p>You start with one farm, but you can get 4 for free and a fifth if
you purchase the weekly pass from the in-game store. There is a strategy
to this part of the process. Follow these instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build your first farm and upgrade to level 5</li>
<li>Build your second farm and upgrade to level 10, unlocking farm
3.</li>
<li>Build your third farm and upgrade to level 10, unlocking farm
4.</li>
<li>Build your fourth farm and upgrade how you like.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upgrading your weekly pass farm does not help you unlock your
free farms!</strong></p>
<p>Mutant Crystals:</p>
<p>Mutant Crystals primarily come from event accomplishments and from
your first time defeating infected monseters (first blood kills). The
first blood doom walker each day (first DW you kill, regardless of
level) also gives you crystals. And, as you may have guessed, you can
buy them from the store.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Infected%20Zombies.jpg"
style="width:35.0%" /></p>
<p>Crystals are essential for upgrading your Protein Farms.</p>
</div>
<div id="killing-infected-zombies" class="section level3">
<h3>Killing Infected Zombies</h3>
<p>Zombies now have new information explaining the minimum recommended
resistance for attacking and rallying. You get higher resistances by
upgrading the Virus Research Institute.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Enemy%20Resistance.png"
style="width:35.0%" /></p>
<p><img
src="Images/Virus%20Research%20Institute.png"
style="width:35.0%" /></p>
<p>When you attack zombies without meeting the minimum resistances, a
few things happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>You deal less damage, especially if you are significantly under the
minimum.</li>
<li>More troops die than usual</li>
<li>Some injured troops become infected and continue to do less
damage</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get around the resistance requirements to some extent with
rallies. As long as the person who rallies meets the requirements for
resistance (and power as usual), the rally should have a good chance. In
this way, higher resistance squads can help carry lower resistance
squads.</p>
<p>Doom Elites are a lot harder this Season. There is a work-around to
help low-power/low-res folks. Coordinate with someone with 1250+
resistance to rally with you. You will have to launch it to get credits,
and because of your low resistance, you will lose lots of troops the
higher the Doom Elite level. However, if you choose a squad and remove
all but 1 hero, you will make sure you take only a fraction of the
normal troops into battle. That’s fine because the other person you’re
working with should have the power to kill the Doom Elite for you.</p>
<p>If you don’t know, you remove heroes from your squad the same way you
add and change them around. Go to the “Garage” just outside your
wall.</p>
</div>
<div id="your-infected-hq" class="section level3">
<h3>Your Infected HQ</h3>
<p>When you attack zombies that are too much for you, some of your squad
comes back infected. This is reflected in a purple icon on your HQ
(world map view). A new icon on the left of your screen also tells you
your infection level. You can share your HQ coordinates in the chat to
have your alliance fam help you clear the infection. You help clear the
infection from someone’s HQ by scouting it. ` <img
src="Images/HQ%20Cleanse.PNG"
style="width:35.0%" /> <img
src="Images/Infection%20Count.PNG"
style="width:35.0%" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, before you get all cleaned up and disinfected by our
loving fam, you should take a squad with infected troops out into the
wild and attack a HQ that <strong>doesn’t belong to any
alliance</strong>. I know. That’s mean. It’s a war game, though. You can
either feel good about yourself or you can complete tasks for rewards
like mutant crystals and immunity protein shakes. You can’t do both.</p>

<h1>Friday Night Lights</h1>
<p>Famiglia,</p>
<p>It’s the first round of the biggest night in Last War:Survival each
week for our new LFG alliance. I want to thank everyone for all the hard
work, dedication and patience. I don’t know that PAL ever had close to
90% of our members at 1 million VS points. You all did that today. And
many of you got out in the mud and earned you 10,000 honor points. Don’t
forget to spend them only on Legendary Gear Blueprints in the honor
shop!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I won’t be around to celebrate and play with you all
tonight. I’ve spent so much of the past week with my face buried in my
phone gaming and coordinating or on my laptop writing this blog that my
wife is about to murder me.</p>
<p>So tonight I’m putting the game down for a while and taking her out
for a much deserved night on the town.</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to tell you that I’m never going to
be mad at you for prioritizing real life needs over this game. This
should be an escape from, not the creator of, stress in your life.
Tonight, I’ll lead by example.</p>
<p>I leave you in very capable hands. Your R4s have been and continue to
work tirelessly to make sure you all can continue to enjoy the game at a
high level. Tonight they will lead your through Desert Storm and prepare
you for Enemy Buster. Do me a favor and take care of the following big
ticket items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server reset happens at 10:00 Eastern, giving way to Day 6 of VS:
Enemy Buster
<ul>
<li>Make sure that by 10:00 all of your squads are out from gathering
and inside your HQ</li>
<li>Make sure you have removed all of your squads from your wall
<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Turn on your 24 hour shield
<ul>
<li>Ideally, you should do this between 10:00 and 10:04 p.m.</li>
<li>If you don’t have one, please buy one in the Alliance shop</li>
<li>If you have to put your shield up before 10:00 (like I do), set an
alarm for tomorrow so you’ll know to log back in and turn another one on
(you may want to use two 12-hour shields or an 8-hour shield to finish
up tomorrow) <br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you’re signed up for Desert Storm:
<ul>
<li>Join the Desert Storm Channel in our Discord and familiarize
yourself with Lizthezard’s battle plan.</li>
<li>Log in on time! Desert Storm starts at 9:00 sharp and goes until
someone clearly wins or 40 minutes is up</li>
<li>Be careful not to use your Healing Speedups in Desert Storm
<ul>
<li>The troops you lose inside the event aren’t lost in your actual
HQ</li>
<li>Healing speed ups used during the event, however, ARE USED UP in
your actual HQ <br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you aren’t in DS, please try and stay out of the chat too much
from 9:00 to 9:40 so the team can communicate while fighting. <br></li>
<li>If you are online tonight from 12:00 (midnight) til 2:00, you will
have your first window for playing Winter Storm. It’s actually more fun
in a lot of ways than Desert Storm and it’s another way to earn Honor
Points. There are a few 2-hour windows for playing in WS, but the first
one is super late tonight. And the second is fairly early in the
morning. Check out the event and read up for more info.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that’s all. I’ve got to get ready for date night. Have fun
tonight, fam.</p>

<h1>Capital War/Capitol Conquest a.k.a “Fun in the Mud”</h1>
<p>Famiglia,</p>
<p>This is the first post today. It’s all about Capital War.</p>
<p>Last War: Survival is clearly designed as a war game. You may have
noticed that the center of the map is gray/brown with a big capital
building in the middle. Each Friday from 10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., the
alliances in the server can battle for control of the capital. The
winning alliance gets to be the President and control lots of stuff for
the server.</p>
<p>Because this game also has server vs server mechanics, the top
alliances in our server (421) have an agreement whereby they peacefully
rotate control of the capital and share the rewards and responsibilites
that go along with it.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, though, this is still an opportunity to earn
Honor Points, which are arguably the most important currency in the game
for reaching the highest power levels for your heroes.</p>
<div id="earning-honor-points-in-capital-war" class="section level2">
<h2>Earning Honor Points in Capital War:</h2>
<p><img
src="Images/Capital%20War%20Main%20Screen.png"
style="width:35.0%" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>During the Capitol Conquest, only commanders battling in
Contaminated Lands (the “mud”) will earn captial war event
points.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Capitol Conquest, you score capital war event points by
inflicting serious injuries and casualities on enemy (other 421
alliance) Units. The higher the troop level, the more event points you
earn.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll also earn event points when your own units die. Higher
level fallen units give more points.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you reach a certain event point threshold, you’ll receive
corresponding Honor Rewards, including honor points.</p></li>

<div id="captial-war-mechanics" class="section level2">
<h2>Captial War Mechanics</h2>
<p><img src="Images/Annotated%20Mud.png"
style="width:35.0%" /></p>
<p>The actual fighting you need to do takes place ONLY IN THE
CONTAMINATED ZONE. That’s the brown/gray mud in the center of the
map.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to participate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You find a resource tile in the in mud that has a red pick axe
icon, signifying that another alliance member is in that tile. Then you
attack that tile. If you lose, it means all your troops are injured or
dead. That sucks, but you still are earning the chance to get honor
points. And while losing troops sucks, you get VS points on Day 5 for
training troops, so there’s a silver lining there, too.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also occupy an empty tile and either wait to be attacked
or share your tile’s coordintes to World Chat so people know you want
them to attack you.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The agreed upon norm in our server says any occupied tile in the mud
during Capital War is fair game for attack. Don’t complain if you were
just harmlessly gathering gold. ore, or food and you get murdered. It’s
not safe out there. This is your fault.</p>
<p>That being said, some people ignore this norm and think you should
only get attacked if you advertise your tile in WC. This is stupid for
many many reasons, but I can’t control other folks. Most alliance
leaders share my view. But you may get angry DMs from people if you
attack their tile without finding it in world chat.</p>
<p>So best practice is to either find a tile in World Chat and attack
it, or post a squad to your own tile and advertise it yourself.</p>

<div id="why-all-the-fuss" class="section level1">
<h1>Why all the fuss?</h1>
<p>As I’ve said before: honor points are the most important late-game
currency as of the time of writing this blog. And they are hard to get.
You cannot upgrade your heroes’ gear beyond level 40 without them.</p>
<p>This is where patience comes into play. The honor point store has a
LOT of tempting items for sale. Before I knew any better, I used to buy
UR shards and UR decoration chests. But I wish had instead been hoarding
all the Legenday Gear Blueprints I could from the beginning. My best
advice is to only spend honor points on gear blueprints. You’ll be glad
you did that later in the game.</p>
<div id="advanced-capital-war-strategy" class="section level2">
<h2>Advanced Capital War Strategy</h2>
<p>If you have a very powerful squad (~17M plus), you can basically
squat on a tile, broadcast it to World Chat and just sit there while you
murder all the troops that attack you.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Capital War takes a bit of time to get to 100,000 event
points, which is when you max out the 10,000 honor points available in
this event.</p>
<div id="finishing-faster" class="section level3">
<h3>Finishing Faster</h3>
<p>The mud makes everything take fover. Your squads move at a fraction
of the time. Resource tile speed boosts don’t matter.</p>
<p>What’s more you can’t even [tile surf]. And even if you win and take
over another tile, you can’t attack a second resource tile from the one
you’re currently on. You have to go back to your HQ and start the
journey over.</p>
<p><strong>Workarounds:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes there aren’t any squads to attack at nearby tiles. Because
travelin in the mud takes FOREVER, you should try to tile sure and
slignshot around the mud using the reosource tiles surrounding the
capital (but not in the contaminated ground). Get as close to the
resource tile you want to attack and then target that one in the
mud.</p>
<p>If you have a powerful squad and you want others to attack you, you
are best served occupying a resource tile in the mud near a different
alliance. You may think that it’s best to choose a tile that is close to
our hive so your squad gets there faster. But LFG famiglia can’t attack
your tile for honor points. So you’ve essentially made it far less
appealing for the people you need to attack you to do so. By occupying a
tile next to other alliances you give them more incentive to attack you.
Don’t do this with a weak squad, though. Once you are defeated you are
redirected strictly through the mud back to your HQ. It takes forever
and you don’t want to have to do that repeatedly.</p>
</div>
<div id="finishing-more-efficiently" class="section level3">
<h3>Finishing More Efficiently</h3>
<p>While it’s true that you get event points when you lose troops, the
better way to get them is by killing other people’s troops. If you have
a super powerful squad, you don’t have to worry too much about this.</p>
<p>If your squads aren’t particularly powerful, though, you need to
scout the resource tiles before you attack. If you are selective in your
attacks and concentrate on squads of comparable/lower power, you have a
better chance of earning your event points from troop kills rather than
troop deaths.</p>
</div>
<div id="micro-healing" class="section level3">
<h3>Micro-healing</h3>
<p>You’re probably going to lose a lot of troops on your way to 10,000
honor points (and the other rewards). If you heal them all in one go it
may take you a day or more. That’s not what you want.</p>
<p>The good news is that Friday is a popular day for playing this game.
Our alliance (LFG and U5A) has good boosts for using the help button.
Every time you ask for help with healing and an alliance member pushes
the help button it takes ~10 minutes off the heal time. Depending on
your Alliance Center level and survivors stationed there, you can get a
lot of time taken off the healing.</p>
<p>It’s best to try to heal in 30-75 minute batches (depending on your
buffs) and ask for help each time. You can get 24 hours of dealing done
in about half an hour depending on how long you stay online and how many
people are active when you are.</p>
<p>You can also use healing speedups in a pinch, but micro-healing is
best as Day 6 is the day for getting VS points for using healing speed
ups.</p>
<p>Have fun in the mud!</p>

<h1>The Road Ahead</h1>
<p>Famiglia,</p>
<p>Congratulations and thank you for a successful merger. We’ve got PAO
vets, LFG newcomers, and U5A transplants all under one roof. Some people
are here for the long haul, others may find this isn’t for them. That’s
ok. I’ll keep saying it: This is a game. Don’t do things that aren’t
enjoyable.</p>
<p>Today I’m going to be releasing some more content on the strategy
guide. I know today is Day 4 of VS, which is Hero upgrade day and is
everyone’s favorite. The VS mechanics for Day 4 are very simple, though.
So I’m going to focus on Day 6: Enemy Buster intead. I’ll explain more
in the <a href="https://rpubs.com/jeffreylharding/LastWar">Strategy
Guide</a> throughout the day. But I want everyone to be thinking about
this stuff starting now.</p>
<div id="shielding-up" class="section level3">
<h3>Shielding Up</h3>
<p>This week we haven’t been laser-focused on winning VS, but we need to
be laser-focused on <em>preparing and learning to win</em> VS.</p>
<p>Day 6 (Enemy Buster- Friday - Saturday evening) is worth 4 points in
the weekly VS battle. The fastest way to earn points on Day 6 is by
killing troops for the other alliance. The fastest way to help the other
alliance win is to lose your troops to them. There are two main ways to
prevent this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a 24 hour shield
<ul>
<li>You can get these in the alliance store.</li>
<li>They cost a lot of alliance points.</li>
<li>Prioritize buying these shields above everything else you buy in the
alliance store</li>
<li>Don’t deploy your 24-hour shield until 2-3 minutes have passed after
reset.
<ul>
<li>There is a 5-minute cool down on enemey buster when you cannot
attack or be attacked and earn/lose points.</li>
<li>You can’t use the free teleported either.</li>
<li>If you use your 24-hour shiled during the 5 minute cool down window,
it wil stay up through the entire Enemy Buster event (unless you scout
or attack a base while it’s active) <br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove your squads from your HQ wall
<ul>
<li>We’ve been putting our squads on the wall of our HQs a lot recently
for Zombie Siege. Make sure you remove them ahead of tomorrow
night.</li>
<li>This shouldn’t be a big deal because your shield makes this a
non-issue.</li>
<li>But just in case… don’t give away kills to the enemy. Take your guys
(and gals) off the walls.</li>
<li>If you don’t know how to do this, ask in the chat.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Shield discipline on Friday night will be the main focus of my
administration. Please do everything you can to protect your base, and
by extension <em>la famiglia</em>.</p>

<div id="nothing-about-this-doesnt-suck" class="section level1">
<h1>Nothing about this doesn’t suck</h1>
<p>All,</p>
<p>I love this game. I play it all the time. Over the past four days
I’ve spent more hours than I can count trying to keep our alliance from
falling apart. Nevertheless, some things are hard to do. I cannot make
everyone happy. I’ve got the DMs to prove it.</p>
<p>The merge with U5A was a coordinated effort in discussion with
multiple folks from PAO as well as other server presidents. We were at
risk of losing everything we’d worked for and the merger was the best
move ahead. I believed it then. I still believe it.</p>
<p>When we agreed to have U5A join us, there were 17 or so empty slots.
U5A needed to bring over 30 or so people. At that time, PAO members were
still leaving, and we have 5-10 accounts spread all across the map who
hadn’t moved to the alliance in weeks. It appeared that there would be
few, if any, instances of people who would need to transition to U5A,
which was to become our growth and learning focused alliance.</p>
<p>I won’t take credit for this, but over the past four days multiple
folks who appeared to be inactive began showing up in ways they hadn’t
in months. It has been amazing.</p>
<p>It also makes the merger more difficult.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t make it wrong.</p>
<p>We want to build an alliance that is a family but is also
competetive. What separates us from other alliances, I believe, is that
we are more interested in earning wins through supporting and helping
one another rather than spending. You’re not going to be kicked out
because you can’t or don’t want to spend money.</p>
<p>I’m sure much of this reads as hypocritical, especially if you end up
getting asked to move to U5A. But let me be clear, there is no path of
“excommunication” here. If we ask you to go to U5A, you will still be a
part of this family. You just wont be in the in-game LFG alliance.</p>
<p>You will <em>still</em>, however, have full access to our discord
chats, this blog, more resources that are coming in the future, the
support of this community, the friendship and camaraderie we have, and
you will also have as much intervention as we can possibly provide if
you get invaded by a strong alliance.</p>
<p>You will also likely have opportunities to serve in a leadership
capacity in U5A. It would be amazing if that alliance became as strong
as this one. This game is actually really well designed to leverage the
power of alliances.</p>
<p>Please know that this absolutely sucks all the way around. I chose
not to leave for multiple other alliances when asked this past weekend
because I just didn’t want to leave so many of you behind.</p>
<p>My DMs are open. Please contact me if you want to complain or
volunteer. There’s no reason for anyone to leave yet. But if we have to
ask people to move to U5A, I will start with those who do volunteer.</p>
<p>While I would love for everyone who leaves to move to U5A, I
understand that you may be pissed at me and not want anything to do with
us. I don’t blame you. You have our blessing, whether you care or not,
to try and join any other alliance that suits you.</p>
<p>With apologies and stress,</p>

<div id="an-open-letter-to-the-family" class="section level1">
<h1>An Open Letter to the Family</h1>
<p>Mia Famiglia,</p>
<p>I address you this way on purpose. <em>La Famiglia</em> means
<em>family</em>. I spend probably 3-4 hours a day playing this game with
you all. I’ve come to know a lot about you and have been blown away at
how cool this group of humans is. If I’m going to spend this much time
with you all, I want to know that we are in a respectful and fun
environment.</p>
<p>At the same time, this is a game about war. There are zombies to be
killed, doom walkers to be toppled, trucks to be plundered, and cities
to be sacked Conquest is literally the prime game mechanic. We need to
be committed to the cause and to each other. We need that ride or die
mentality. When Makosa rallies a level 140 Doomie, I want you to think,
“Lets freaking go!” When it’s Friday night and Desert storm kicks off, I
want you to think, “Lets FREAKING go!” And when server reset flips and
it’s time for Enemy Buster and that level 30 Disco Kitty lands in our
base, I want you to be chill because you are in the safety of your
shield. But in your heart, through your bones, deep down to your soul I
want you to feel like shouting “LET’S FREAKING GOOOOOOOOO!”</p>
<p>It’s in this spirit that I’m announcing that we are retiring PAO
Mavericks. This is a new alliance now. We are a family ready to get
after it. We may not outspend anyone, but we will grind these upgrades
and get each other’s backs every day. Why? Because we are family.</p>
<p>We are lfG: La FamiGlia</p>

<h3>Big Ticket Items</h3>
<div id="new-alliance-location" class="section level4">
<h4>NEW ALLIANCE LOCATION</h4>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to be placing a new Alliance Marker on the West side of
the capital (Look left of the mud in the center of the map. We will be
around 10:00 on the “clock face”).
<ul>
<li>You will have until reset tomorrow (Wendesday, August 7, 10 pm
Eastern) to move there</li>
<li>If you are not with us at the capital, you risk being booted from
the alliance to make room for the new U5A members merging with us.
<ul>
<li>I want everyone to use an Advanced Teleporter instead of an Alliance
teleporter</li>
<li>The Advanced Teleporter allows you to choose your location rather
than being automatically placed near the flag.</li>
<li>Please be very deliberate and careful with your HQ placement. The
goal is to arrange our alliance into strict columns and rows.</li>
<li>DO NOT BE THAT PERSON WHO THROWS OFF THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT</li>
<li>You can purchase Advanced Telporters in the VIP store for 600
diamomds or in the Alliance Store for 7,500 Alliance points. <br> <img

<div id="todays-goals" class="section level3">
<h3>Today’s Goals</h3>
<p>Day 2 is a good day for VS. You get rewarded for upgrading buildings.
Sadly this takes a while. On the plus side, you also get rewarded for UR
(gold/legendary) Trucks and Secret Tasks. Follow these pro-tips to help
boost your score today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to Arms Race. Don’t unwrap your completed buildings
and save your construction speedups for 6:00 - 9:59 p.m. Eastern
time.</li>
<li>Use trade contracts to refresh your trucks and get UR ones.</li>
<li>Use secret orders and diamonds to refresh your Secret Tasks to UR
status</li>
<li>BE PATIENT
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to dispatch trucks and secret tasks as soon as you
can. You have a 24 hour window in which to dispatch them all.</li>
<li>Throughout the day you will open chests and get rewards from
multiple parts of the game that may have Trade Contracts, Secret Orders,
and diamonds.</li>
<li>Instead of dispatching purple, green, blue and grays, wait a few
hours and see if you get more options to refresh.
<ul>
<li>Trade contracts for refreshing UR Trucks look like this <br> <img
src="Images/Trade%20Contract.png"
style="width:15.0%" /></li>
<li>Secret Orders for refreshing Secret Tasks look like this <br> <img
src="Images/Secret%20Orders.JPG"
style="width:15.0%" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Please keep an eye on the Ally Tasks tab. When your secret tasks are
ready to collect, other alliances can plunder you and rob rewards. If an
ally assists you, however, your rewards are protected, and you can even
help folks get bonuses when they collect. It’s a win win.</li>
<li>This is where you help your alliance famiglia. Check this often.
Especially on VS boost days. <br> <img
src="Images/Ally%20Task%20Assist%20Tab.png"
style="width:35.0%" /> <br></li>
<li>This is what I should see because my alliance assited me (this is an
old screenshot) <br> <img
src="Images/Perfect%20Assists.png"
style="width:35.0%" /></li>
<li>This is what it looks like when your people don’t assist your tasks
and others plunder your goods and cost you bonus chances for extra map
pieces. <br> <img

style="width:35.0%" /> <br></li>
</ul></li>

<div id="pao-update-for-august-5-2024" class="section level2">
<h2>PAO Update for August 5, 2024</h2>
<p>PAO Famiglia,</p>
<p>I have huge news that should take us all in an exciting new
direction. We have heard your cries for new blood in the alliance and we
want you to know that you are not alone.</p>
<p>I have been working with Lizthezard and Ntiva very closely to work
out the terms and details of an alliance merger. We have taken this very
seriously because so many of us spend much of our days in and out of the
game, chatting and hanging out and–hopefully-kicking some booty.
Considering how tumultuous the last few days and weeks have been, we
have been reluctant to do anything else that was so invasive. However,
with the launch of Season 1 only a week away, we decided that now is the
time to act.</p>
<div id="tldr-we-are-merging-with-u5a" class="section level3">
<h3>TL;DR We Are Merging with U5A</h3>
<p>After much consideration and communication, we have decided to merge
with the U5A alliance. There are many reasons why we think this was the
right choice. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>U5A is the sister alliance of PAL.<br />
</li>
<li>We will continue to have protection and support of an extremely
powerful alliance</li>
<li>We will stay connected to many of our friends who have migrated to
PAL.</li>
<li>You will likely have opportunities as you grow to apply to PAL if
you wish to pursue a more aggressively competitive gampeplay
experience.</li>
<li>U5A will bring a core of ~30 members, including three R4s who are
experienced and active players.</li>
<li>The U5A culture is a perfect fit to mesh with ours. They are focused
on growing, learning, and teaching instead of pressuring to win VS
battles each week at all costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merger Mechanics</strong></p>
<p><em>Leadership</em>: The leader of U5A has agreed that I will remain
the R5 and leader of the new merged alliance. They will bring several R4
players with them and help us cooradinate and teach.</p>
<p><em>Location</em> We are planning to move back to the capital. We are
still working on a spot, but we will notify you tomorrow. You’ll have
until Wednesday evening server reset to teleport to the new assembly.
Alliance teleporters are available in the shops and are very cheap (no
money required). Those HQs that do not make it to the capital by
Wednesday evening will be considered inactive and not interested in the
merger. They will be added to our list of members that need to
transition elsewhere once we merge (more on this below).</p>
<p>If you need help getting to the capital or can’t afford (or are out
of purchases for) an alliance teleport, reach out to me (Golbez)
directly. We will try to work it out so that you can wait until Friday
and teleport when it is free.</p>
<p>We are choosing to do this before Friday evening vs for a few
reasons. Most of all, though, we see this as a show of your commitment
and buy in for the future of the alliance.</p>
<p><em>PAO Membership</em> Our alliance can have 100 members. We are
currently between 80-85. With 30-35 U5A members expected, there will be
some reshuffling to be expected.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the most part, if you are active in PAO, you will almost
certainly remain (if you choose to).</li>
<li>We are going to go through our current membership and identify
players who are inactive or rarely log in. Those will be removed from
the alliance and notified. If this does not get enough spaces open for
U5A, we will ask for volunteers who are interested in a new
alliance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHICH BRINGS ME TO U5A MEMBERSHIP</strong></p>
<p>U5A is not going away. Their leader, Not So Elite, is going to
maintain a second account there and keep watch over it. This will be the
preferred alliance for the most casual of our players. If you need to
take a break for a while or you just only check your HQ a few times a
week, you can join U5A to play at a leisurely pace while enjoying the
protection of TWO sister alliances.</p>
<p>U5A will also be a place where you can go and get some experience
serving as an R4 and fighting in Desert Storm. This might even be a good
place for starting a second account (if you’re brave enough). The
downside of moving here is that there are fewer active players,
especially since the most active ones are joining us in PAO. On the
bright side, U5A has existing tech and alliance bonuses, so you aren’t
starting from scratch. I really think this could be a fun place for some
folks who just want to play and not have one more thing to worry
about.</p>
<p><em>PAO Culture</em></p>
<p>The new merged alliance will evolve and develop its own distinct
culture. However, the leadership of both U5A and PAO are on the same
page when it comes to building a community that promotes enjoying the
game through fun, respect, growth, teaching, and learning. We will
strive to be competetive through those channels. But we have no plans of
becoming an alliance that puts winning above all else. There is nothing
wrong with that mentality. This is not only a game, but it is a game
that’s literally got WAR in the name. But that gameplay isn’t for
everyone.</p>
<p>I know this is a lot, and I hope you’ve made it to the end here.
Please keep the following in mind as we move forward this week:</p>
<p><strong><em>Our goal is to make sure no one has to leave who doesn’t
want to. We have workded very hard the last 48+ hours to keep this
family together and we have no intention of ruining anyone’s game
experience. It’s 100% the opposite. If you have any questions or
concerns, just send a DM to Golbez or Ntiva.</em></strong></p>
<p>Big things ahead. LFG.</p>

<div id="pao-update-for-august-4-2024" class="section level2">
<h2>PAO Update for August 4, 2024</h2>
<p>PAO Famiglia,</p>
<p>Thank you again for your patience and support the past 24 hours (and
more if you aren’t new). Let me start with a reminder that this is a
game. Everything the leadership and I are working on is meant to help
create a culture of enjoying each other and the game. At 10 pm Eastern
time, we will receive our next opponent in VS. This opponent will likely
be very strong since our matching was made based on our power weeks
ago.</p>
<p>I would like to ask that this week we not stress out over VS. We have
a long road ahead of us. Instead of throwing all of your resources
(Speedups, Diamonds, dollars) into a VS battle we likely won’t win,
apply your efforts in a way that maximizes your personal HQ growth.
Everything you do to get stronger still helps the alliance. Even if we
win, the rewards aren’t great for VS compared to the benefits you will
get from Arms Race and upgrades you make sooner rather than later. This
won’t always be our approach but it is this week.</p>
<p>For tonight and tomorrow, focus on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read all Alliance Announcements and vote in the poll</li>
<li>Save radar tasks until reset</li>
<li>Add your soldiers on the wall of your base (click the + button in
the house) for Zombie Invasion at 8 pm</li>
<li>Remain online until Zombie Siege is over. Keep mashing the help
button!</li>
<li>Pause activity from 10-10:05 Eastern. This is good practice.</li>
<li>Check the arms race calendar and try to synchronize your activities
with those time frames. Arms Race rewards are awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be a lot more info coming in the next few days. Keep
logging in and check the announcements.</p>
