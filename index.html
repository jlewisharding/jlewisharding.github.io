<h1>Overview</h1>
</div>
<div id="game-meta" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Game Meta</strong></h1>
<p>Last War: Survival can be considered a game in two phases.</p>
<p>Initially, the gameplay takes the form of the scrolling zombie battle
game that you see advertised on social media all the time. While this
type of game play remains a part of the game to some extent, it’s mostly
used as a way to get people sucked into playing the game while they get
you hooked on the second phase (hoping you’ll stick around and spend
money).</p>
<p>The second phase of game play is all about strategic base
development. It’s like SIM City, Age of Empires, and other classic
empire building game formats. What perhaps make this game a little
different (and more fun in my opinion), is the intentional design to
make joining an alliance essential. While there are certainly ways to
enjoy the game playing on your own (more about that here), the Devs have
clearly made the majority of the focus the events and tasks that are
oriented around cooperation with your alliance and combat against other
alliances and servers.</p>
<p><br> <br> <br></p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="alliance-duel-weekly-vs-battle-strategy"
class="section level1">
<h1>Alliance Duel: Weekly VS Battle Strategy</h1>
<p>Alliance duel is one of the biggest parts of this game. Some would
argue it’s the main point of the game. The idea is that 6 out of 7 days
each will, alliance members complete in-game tasks that earn points for
your alliance. Every day has a different theme. To maximize your
performance, you not only have to do the correct tasks on the optimal
day, but you have to be patient and plan on the other 6 days to ensure
you aren’t wasting “future” points. It’s definitely a balance.</p>
<p>It’s important to know that Last War:Surival is a <em>pay to win</em>
game. In other words, you can employ all of the strategy you can and
play this game 24/7, and you’ll still not stand a chance again people
who spend actual real-world money on the game (you can read more of my
thoughts on spending real money here). That being said, you can grind
your way to success and can often win by being smart instead of
rich.</p>
<p>The first step to playing smart is to upgrade your Aliance Duel tech
in the Tech Center.</p>
<p><a id="TechCenter"></a> <br></p>
<div id="the-tech-center" class="section level2">
<h2>The Tech Center</h2>
<p>Every HQ has at least one Tech Center. You can purchase a second tech
center for $9.99, which is not required, but it will drastically improve
your ability to grow in the game.I intentionally don’t pressure people
to spend money on this game. However, the second Tech Center makes my
list of Top 5 Real Money Spends in the game.</p>
<p>The first image shows you what your tech center looks like. The
second image shows you the research tech domains you can access (at
varying levels).</p>
<p><img src="Images/Tech%20Centers.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" /> <img
src="Images/Tech%20Research%20Paths.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<p>When you click on the Alliance Duel domain (VS icon), you will see
many options that give bonuses to the tasks we need to perform each week
to earn VS points. I am highlighting the Radar tech in the top left
corner. Mine happens to be fully completed. This means that on days when
radar tasks give VS points, mine give 150% percent of the base points
(100% base + 50% buff). In other words, each radar task I complete
increases my/our VS Duel points by 25,000. So a member with a lower
research level is doing the same thing I am but is getting a fraction of
the points for it.</p>
<p><img

<p><img
src="Images/Focused%20Radar%20Upgrade.jpg"
class="enlargeable" style="width:30.0%" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve completed an upgrade, you will always get the higher
points in each week’s Alliance Duel.You will see that there are buffs
for nearly everything we do that earns Alliance Duel points. This is the
first and most important step you can take to improving your
contributions to the Alliance Duel.</p>
</div>
<div id="daily-schedule-for-alliance-duel" class="section level2">
<h2>Daily Schedule for Alliance Duel</h2>
<p>Each day of Alliance Duel is worth a different point value. Day 1 is
worth 1 point, Days 2 - 5 are worth 2 points, and Day 6 (Enemy Buster)
is worth 4 points. There are basically two main approaches to winning
the weekly duel.</p>
<p>The first approach minimizes the importance of Day 1 since it is only
worth 1 point. The thinking is that if you win two of the four days that
are worth 2 points and you win Day 6, which is worth 4 points, then the
1 point from Day is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can treat a Day One victory as essential and then
focus on wining three of the four days that are worth 2 points each.
Although this method requires you two win more Days, it makes Day 6
(Enemy Buster) irrelevant, despite it being worth 4 points. This
strategy is preferable for alliances that have been matched up with much
more powerful enemies.</p>

<h4 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">Alliance VS Battles “Day 0”
(Sunday)</h4>
<p>They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Well, today
I’m going to talk about how an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of
VS points. That’s right. Earning points for Monday is something that
actually starts on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO I DO THAT!?</strong></p>
<p>There are two main ways to prepare in advance for higher Day 1 point
totals.</p>
<div id="gathering-resources" class="section level5">
<h5>Gathering Resources</h5>
<p>It may not be the largest point gainer, but the
<strong>easiest</strong> way to earn points on Day 1 of versus is to
gather resources from the resource tiles (gold mines, iron mines, and
wheat fields). Actually, though, you get the points <em>when you leave
the resource tiles</em>. This is a very important technical point
because it means you can start earning Day 1 VS points before Day 1
begins. The main idea is that you make sure that when Day 1 points open
for earning (around 10:05 Eastern on Sunday nights) you have squads
already in the resource tiles. Once the earning window opens and you
leave the tile (whether manually or automatically by gathering all the
resources in the tile), you will get credit for all of the resources
cashed in at that time. So let’s say for example that you began
gathering gold at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday and left the tile at 10:06 p.m. on
Sunday, you would get credit not only for the 6 minutes of collecting
that began at server reset, but also for the 7 hours of gathering you
did earlier in the day. The kicker to all of this is that you have to
keep the squads in the tile until after reset. If you leave any time
before 10:05, you will not receive any credit.</p>
</div>
<div id="saving-and-researching-radar-tasks" class="section level5">
<h5>Saving and Researching Radar Tasks</h5>
<p>It’s easy to get so caught up in just clicking on radar tasks that
you don’t pay attention to the extra information on the screen. But
there’s a lot of valuable info there that can help you maximize points
and tasks and hopefully digs.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at an important screen (It’s actually two screen
shots combined into one). You can click the photo to enlarge, and if
you’re on mobile, turn your phone sideways helps, too.</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img
src="Images/Radar%20Screen%20Explained.png"
class="enlargeable" /></p>
</div>
<p>Depending on your Radar Level, you get a certain number of tasks
every six hours. Tasks require two actions. The first action is
completing. This requires 10 stamina per task and can include assisting
an ally’s task, attacking a doom elite HQ (specially generated for the
radar task), killing a doom walker, killing a doom elite, collecting
from supercharged resource tiles (dramatically increased gathering
speed), or hosting a dig site!</p>
<p>Once you complete the task, the icon on your screen will change to
include a red dot. <em>But you do not have to COLLECT the tasks as soon
as you complete them!</em> You can leave the task on the radar map and
the red dot will hold its place. When you are ready to collect the task,
simply tap the icon with the red dot. This two-step process allows you
to complete the tasks before they expire while still holding onto them
until the days when you receive VS rewards for completing radar
tasks.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that each Radar Level has a cap to the number of tasks
you can have “on hold” (completed but not collected). Once you’ve hit
the max holding number associated with your level, you are likely better
served collecting your 6-hour refresh number of tasks. This is because
once you hit the max holding number, your refresh clock stops counting
down. So if you sit on 40/40 tasks for example, once you complete them,
<strong>only then</strong> will the clock start counting again. So even
though you’ve been waiting a long time, you still have to wait 6 more
hours for new ones.</p>

<div id="boosting-radar-task-points-through-tech-center-research"
class="section level5">
<h5>Boosting Radar Task Points through Tech Center Research</h5>
<p>What’s really importan in all of this is that you remember to keep
playing the long game. Radar tasks are incredible sourcest of VS points
throughout the week. But you can make them even more lucrative by maxing
the radar tech in the VS Tech domain at the Tech Center. You can see
more about that in my strategy guide.</p>
<p><a href="#RadarTraining">Back to Day 1 Overview</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="day-1-strategy" class="section level4">
<h4>Day 1 Strategy</h4>
<p>Day 1 is a tricky day because your alliance really needs to make a
decision about whether they want to <strong>try</strong> to win Day 1.
This is because Day 1 is worth only 1 point in the weekly alliance duel
contest. In many weeks, the 1 point difference isn’t worth worrying
about. However, if you see on Sunday night that the alliance you match
up with severely outmatches you in HQ power, which likely means you’ll
get destroyed on Day 6: Enemy Buster, which is worth 4 points, you may
want to give a Day 1 victory some serious thought.</p>
<p>If you know you likely can’t win Day 6, you can try instead to win
Day 1 and then three of the other four days worth 2 points each.
Basically, as long as your team gets 7 points, then it doesn’t matter
who wins Day 6. So you can just have everyone put on a 24-hour shield
and do some fun team building stuff like Marshall or Zombie Siege or
some Seasonal activities that don’t break your shield.</p>
<p>You can still lose Day 1: Radar Training and Day 6: Enemy Buster and
win the alliance duel for the week by winning all the other days. But
many alliances don’t try as hard to win Day 1 and so it may be an easier
path to victory. In any case, it’s something worth considering.</p>

<em>Alliance Duel Victory Value: 2 Points</em>
</center>
<p><br> <br> <br> Day 2: Base Expansion is a great day because you get
rewarded in Alliance Duel with VS points for stuff you wanted to do
anyway. As always, pay attention to the times during Arms Race when you
can be earning VS points <strong>and</strong> Arms Race points. This is
not the salsa bowl. Golbez encourages double dipping.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 1 Minute Construction Speed-Up (VS points per speed-up
minute)</li>
<li>Increase Building Power by 1 Point (VS points times total power
increase)</li>
<li>Dispatch UR (legendary/gold) Truck 1 Time (VS points for each
truck)</li>
<li>Perform 1 Legendary (gold/UR) Secret Task (VS points for each
dispatch)</li>
<li>Buy Packs Containing Diamonds (30 points for each diamond)</li>
<li>Recruit 1 Survivor (Points for each survivor <em>recruitment
ticket</em> you use)</li>
</ul>
<div id="recruit-survivors" class="section level4">
<h4>Recruit Survivors</h4>
<p>There’s not a lot to this one. It’s important to know that you get
points for each survivor recruitment ticket you use and not just for
actually getting a <em>new</em> survivor. This distinction matters for a
few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of your tickets will result in survivor tokens and not actual
survivors.</li>
<li>After a while, you stop getting <em>new</em> survivors and just get
duplicates</li>
<li>You can get a new survivor from Doom Walker first blood kills as
well as from upgrading your HQ, and these don’t count for VS.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="building-power-and-construction-speedups"
class="section level4">
<h4>Building Power and Construction Speedups</h4>
<p>This seems pretty straight-forward. You upgrade a building. You use
speed-ups. You get points. But there’s a little more nuance I can
epxlain here.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can earn points for spending both Construction speedups and
universal speedups. The type of speedup does not affect point
values.</li>
<li>You get credit for the building power increase when the constuction
<em>is completed</em> and not when you start construction.</li>
<li>When a building is finished being constructed or upgraded, it will
show up in your headquarters as a yellow/orange package with a red bow.
<ul>
<li>The building will stay that way until you tap it and confirm it on
the message that pops up.</li>
<li>While the building is still wrapped up, it continues to provide
benefits (e.g., gold from gold mines), but only at the level it was at
when you started the upgrade. For example, if your HQ is gift-wrapped
and will be level 27 when you open it, you won’t be able to unlock
anything that requires HQ level 27 until you pull the ribbon, so to
speak.</li>
<li>Savvy commanders will upgrade buildings throughout the week and
leave them wrapped up until the days that reward VS points for
increasing building power. This works better for some buildings than
others. For example, my level 22 gold mine is fine to sit there and
produce gold at level 21 for another day or 2. However, I likely don’t
want to leave my Level 27 HQ just sitting at a level 26 for three
days.</li>
<li>Gift-wrapped resource-producing buildings can still be harvested by
1-click gathering (HQ 20+) and by shaking the phone to collect (VIP 9
active or permanently unlocked at HQ24+).</li>
</ul></li>

<div id="perform-legendary-secret-tasks" class="section level4">
<h4>Perform Legendary Secret Tasks</h4>
<p><a id="LegendaryTasks"></a></p>
<p>Legendary Secret Tasks are amazing for many reasons. Primarily,
though, they are amazing because you get map pieces for dispatching the
Legendary (gold/UR) tasks. When you collect all 7 map pieces, you can
turn them in for a free chest, which can have incredible rewards.</p>
<p>Although you can launch legendary secret tasks every day, only a few
Alliance Duel Days reward you with VS points. Day 2: Base Expansion is
one of those days.</p>
<p>There are a few key ways to maximize VS points this way. First,
<strong>remember that you only get VS points for launching LEGENDARY
secret tasks.</strong></p>
<p>You also can increase the amount of VS points you get from secret
tasks by upgrading the Duel Expert tech at the <a

<p><br> At max level, you will double the amount of VS points you earn
for each <strong>Legendary</strong> Secret Task you launch.</p>
<p>The second way that you can maximize your VS points from legendary
tasks is through refreshing blue and purple tasks so that they become
legendary. Refreshing secret tasks “re-rolls” the rarity of the task. If
you refresh enough times (which can be a <strong>lot</strong> of times),
you are guaranteed to eventually get more legenedary tasks. Here are
things to keep in mind when refreshing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refreshing applies to ALL tasks that have not been deployed. So make
sure you wait until all avaialable legendary tasks have a squad
dispatched to them.</li>
<li>Refreshing tasks is not free. In fact, you could call it expensive.
Here’s how you do it:
<ul>
<li>Secret Orders: You can obtain Secret Orders a number of ways. You
can purchase them in some of the stores, or you can get them from
opening chests. I rarely purchase them any more as I find that I get
enough throughout the day.</li>
<li>Diamonds: You can refresh secret tasks for 100 diamonds. This can
get expensive. But at the end of the the day for VS, especially when
it’s close, many of us think, “Man! I wish I could just buy 1,000,000
more VS points for 1,000 diamonds!” Well, this is how you do that.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The third and cheapest way to maximize points from Legendary Secret
tasks is by just exercising patience and restraint, which for most of us
makes this the most difficult way. But if you find yourself staring at a
bunch of purple and blue tasks with no Secret Orders left and you just
can’t bring yourself to spend the last 100 diamonds you have got to your
name, then <strong>just wait</strong>. There are no doubt many more
chests and rewards that are going to come your way throughout the day.
It’s almost guaranteed you’re going to get more diamonds or Secret
Orders before reset. I see alliance members with lots of blue and purple
tasks discpatched with 12 hours left in the day. That’s just leaving
easy VS points on the table.</p>

<h4>Dispatch UR Trucks</h4>
<br>
<center>
<img src="Images/Trucks%20In%20HQ.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" />
</center>
<p><br> There are multiple ways to get to your trade trucks, and I’ve
tried to capture them all in this one screenshot. The third one takes
you to the Truck Plunder screen, but you can still get to your own
trucks by clicking the eponymous “Your Truck” tab.</p>
<p>There are a few factors that can affect the number of trucks you can
have out at once, but it’s essentially tied to the number of
squads/garages you have unlocked. In any case, the max number out at
once doesn’t directly affect your ability to earn VS points, so I won’t
get into that here.</p>
<p>As with <a href="#LegendaryTasks">Performing Legendary Secret
Tasks</a>, you only get credit for dispatching UR (gold/legendary) trade
trucks. The amount of points you receive also depends on the various
upgrades you have made in the tech center.</p>
<p>Unlike Secret Tasks, though, you can make <em>extensive</em> upgrades
to your Trade Trucks at the <a href="#TechCenter">Tech Center</a>. I
won’t go into all of that here, but this is where you will go to make
various improvements to your truck driving experience.</p>
<center>
<img src="Images/Truck%20Upgrades.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" /> <img
src="Images/Extra%20Truck.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" />
</center>
The Extra Truck Upgrade, as you may have guessed, is only one level, but
it allows you to dispatch one extra truck every day. So at max levels,
you can dispatch five UR trucks per day, for 200,000 VS points each.
That’s right. You get 1 MILLION VS points just for sending out those
sweet golden combat G Wagons.
<center>
<img src="Images/Free%20Roll.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" /> <img
src="Images/Trade%20Contract%20Refresh.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" /> <img
src="Images/Empty%20Truck%20Lanes.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" />
</center>
<p><br> Increasing the number of trucks per day won’t help you much if
you aren’t making sure they are all UR (gold/legendary) quality. You can
make sure they are all UR level by refreshing the rarity. As with all
things in this game, it’s not free. You will need either Trade Contracts
or Diamonds. Each refresh attempt is 1 Trade Contract or 100 Diamonds.
The good news is that you actually get one free refresh <strong>per
truck slot</strong>. So before you go spending diamonds and contracts.
See if you can get a UR truck on the open lane (+ button with no
truck).</p>
<p>The advice here is the same as with Legendary secret tasks. You get
points when the trucks are <strong>deployed</strong>, not when they
return. So you have a 24-hour window to wait and get enough contracts or
diamonds to make sure they are all UR status. And just like with
Legendary Secret Tasks you should be thinking about this in the sense
that when you run out of contracts, you are “purchasing” VS points with
diamonds. I think that 1,000 diamonds or more is worth it for 200,000 VS
points.</p>

<em>Alliance Duel Victory Value: 2 Points</em>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Day 3 Explained</strong></p>
<p>Day 3 (Age of Science) Rewards VS points for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech Center Research
<ul>
<li>Completing Research</li>
<li>Using Research Speedups</li>
<li>Using Valor Badges</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increasing Tech Power (which comes from completing research)</li>
<li>Completing Radar Tasks</li>
<li>Opening Drone Compenent Chests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prioritizing</strong></p>
<p><em>Upgrades with Valor Badges</em></p>
<p>The way to earn the most VS points on Day 3 is by upgrading tech that
requires the use of valor badges, which can be viewed in your
inventory’s “Special” tab and look like this:</p>
<p><img src="Images/Valor%20Badges.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<p>There are multiple ways to acquire valor badges, but that doesn’t
make them easy to get. You likely won’t be able to upgrade ever
valor-badge tech you want each time it’s the Age of Science. You simply
will run out of those before you run out of speedups and gold.</p>
<p>The following tech domains require valor badges for upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Alliance Duel</p></li>
<li><p>Special Forces</p></li>
<li><p>Intercity Truck</p></li>
<li><p>Siege to Seize</p></li>
<li><p>Defense Fortifications</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Radar Tasks</em></p>
<p>This can be a huge and easy source of points. But this is mostly true
when you have maxed out the radar boost in the Alliance Duel Tech domain
in the research center. I am <strong>extremely</strong> reluctant to
tell people how to spend their money, but I do not advise paying the
$4.99 for a radar replenish. It can purchase 1,000,000 VS points when
you are fully upgraded, but this is typically nowhere near enough to
flip the outcome of the day. What’s more, you have basically nothing to
show for your money. The benefit is almost immediately gone.</p>
<p><em>Drone Component Chests</em></p>
<p>The hardest part about getting points opening drone component chests
is just waiting 6 days to spend them each week as Day 3 is the only time
you get VS points for them. The very high level chests can boost your
score very quickly, but those are extremely difficult to obtain. As I
said before, the best thing you can do is keep staring at the image
below six days and not touching them.</p>
<p><img
src="Images/Drone%20Component%20Chests.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" /></p>
<p><strong>Maximizing with the Secretary of Science Buff</strong></p>
<p>Most of the time (I won’t go into the exceptions here), you can apply
at the capital for the Secretary of Science (and other) position. The
server’s First Lady appoints people to this position once they have
applied. Generally, when it is your turn, you will have the Secretay of
Science position for 5 minutes only. During this time, you will get a
50% reduction in research time added to your existing buffs. This means
it doesn’t cut the time you see in half. It’s more complicated than
that. Nevertheless, it can take DAYS (yes, days!) off of your time for
research at the higher levels.</p>
<p>To apply for Secretary of Science Position, you can click the
“Capital” crown icon that is sometimes visible on the right hand side of
your screen. When that icon is not there, you need to go to your
profile, select the server (421), and then select the “Officials”
(building) icon.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Capital%20Icon.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:15.0%" /> <img
src="Images/Secretary%20of%20Science.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p><img src="Images/Capital%20Officials.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>Make sure that you plan ahead. The wait list is usually very long.
Each person in line is a minimum 5 minute wait. Count how many are ahead
of you, multiply by 5, and then set an alarm for close to the time when
you should be up. Keep in mind that some First Lady’s skip over folks in
the quere who are not online. So it’s possible that you will get skipped
if you sign off. Getting this buff can be a serious committment on Day 3
of VS, but it’s definitely worth it.</p>
<p>Once the buff is active, choose small research tasks (in terms of
time). Start the task and then burn through all of the research speedups
I know you’ve been saving. Complete as many research levels as possible,
focusing on those that use Valor Badges. Watch your point total
skyrocket while you get super strong.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: The Secretary of Science position also gives you a 25% boost
to building construction time reduction, so you can double dip.
Similarly, the Secretary of Development Position gives you a 25%
research boost in addition to the 50% construction boost. So if you
don’t feel like waiting in line for Secretary of Science, you can
usually get the Development position faster and sacrifice some
times.</p>

<div id="hq-advancement" class="section level1 tabset tabset-pills">
<h1 class="tabset tabset-pills">HQ Advancement</h1>
<p>If you’ve made it to HQ 15 or so, then you no doubt have discovered
the two main barriers to base expansion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tab below tells you a bit about how to deal with each.</p>
<div id="time" class="section level2">
<h2>Time</h2>
<p>When you first start playing the game, the time required for
constructing and upgrading the various buildings in your headquarters is
typically measured in minutes and hours. Before too long, you start
seeing that building upgrades take more than a day. You get used to that
just in time for your required upgrades that start requiring weeks. When
you finish wiping away your tears, you then notice that upgrades once
you get to HQ 25 or 26 can take a month or more. Headquarters in
particular can take 2 or more months to upgrade once you get to level 27
and beyond. Now, the simplest and cheapest way to deal with this is to
just… wait it out. But if you’ve made it to level 24 or so, then you’ve
clearly shown that you like this game too much to just
<strong>wait</strong> like some newb. You NEED those upgrades.</p>
<p>So if you don’t want to just wait it out, here are the time hacks you
need to know about.</p>
<div id="extra-construction-queues" class="section level4">
<h4>Extra Construction Queues</h4>
<p>The most effective, pound-for-pound way to build and upgrade faster
is to have multiple construction queues available. They say “Many hands
make light work.” This is the idea. It’s not hard to understand either.
Let’s say you have two upgrades that each take one week. With the
default number (1) of construction queues, this will take you two weeks.
But with a second queue, you can do both at the same time, cutting your
time in half. You can have this incredible boost for $1.99. Now, here in
LFG we don’t push people to spend real money on this game. Nevertheless,
some people choose to do so, and the second construction queue tops my
list of <a
href="https://www.lastwar.pro/strategyguide#Top_5_In-Game_purchases">best
in-game purchases</a>. You can also purchase a third and fourth
construction queue for $9.99 and $19.99, respectively. I personally
think the third queue is worth it. However, these extra queues have
diminishing returns because as you advance in HQ level and building
power, building upgrades become exceedingly more expensive in terms of
resources. There will be many times when you have a third builder that
is sitting idle because you simply cannot afford to build anything else
in your HQ because everything costs 500 million of each resources (I
address resources in the other tab in this section). The idea of a
fourth construction queue may seem worth it early on, but once you hit
HQ 26 or so, you will probably just be unable to use it often.</p>
</div>
<div id="speed-buffs" class="section level4">
<h4>Speed-Buffs</h4>
<p>There are several ways to increase the construction speed of your
base at the outset (meaning you have to to this <strong>before you start
the build</strong>).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Apply for the Secretary of Development Buff- I won’t explain the
whole idea behind offices here, but you get a 20% buff to your
construction speed while you are the Secretary of Development. Whenever
you have a building that takes more than a day or so, you should endure
even the longest of lines for this buff. <br><br> If you’re in a hurry,
and the line for Secretary of Development is long, and you just have
some smaller upgrades to make, you can also try to get the Secretary of
Science buff, which gives a 10% increase to your construction speed.
It’s not a great plan for upgrades that take a long time</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade Your Alliance Center- The alliance center doesn’t get a
lot of attention, but the higher the level, the higher number of allies
you can have help you build. And when you add in the Lawyers (survivors)
to the mix, the time enhancements get increased even more.</p></li>
<li><p>Get The Engineer Boost from an Alliance Member- Season 1 brought
some big changes to the meta. One was the introduction of
Professions.</p></li>
<li><p>Buy the Pyramid Decoration Very Early On- Most people reading
this won’t be able to take advantage of this. However, during the first
few days you play the game, you have an opportunity to purchase the
pyramid. Most people don’t buy it because they are still very new to the
game during the only window it’s available for purchase. The good news
is that once you buy it, you can continue to upgrade it with Universal
Decor Components like you do any other UR decoration.</p></li>

</div>
<div id="purchase-speedups" class="section level4">
<h4>Purchase Speedups</h4>
<p>There are four task-specific speedups as well as universal speedups.
You can use construction speedups and universal speedups for
constructing and upgrading buildings. These can be obtained through
chests and other in-game reward mechanisms.They can also be purhcased
through multiple stores. Different stores offer different options. Most
weeks you will find yourself trying to balance where you buy your
speedups as you may find you need to buy something with diamonds that
isn’t available in the alliance store (or <em>vice versa</em>).</p>
</div>
<div id="ask-for-alliance-tech-upgrades" class="section level4">
<h4>Ask for Alliance Tech Upgrades</h4>
<p>This isn’t something you can do on your own, but every alliance has a
list of Alliance Tech buffs that can be upgraded by members spending
coins and diamonds. Several of these techs can help you build faster.

first instead of trying to maximize small but relatively inconsequential
buffs.</p>

<div id="zombie-invasion"

<h2 class="tabset tabset-pills tabset-fade">Zombie Invasion</h2>
<p><img src="Images/Zombie%20Invasion%20Menu.png"
class="enlargeable" /></p>
<p>I like to refer to Zombie Invasion as “The Most Wonderful Time of the
Year.” What’s not to love about Zombie Invasion? Little leprechaumbies
that crap out big fat Zombie Bosses when you kill them? Sweet (and I
mean <em>sweet</em>) rewards. In fact, that’s where I’ll start.</p>
<div id="zombie-invasion-mechanics" class="section level3">
<h3>Zombie Invasion Mechanics</h3>
<p>This event is straightforward. The server map populates with
delicious little level 10 zombies holding pots of gold (henceforward
known as leprechaumbies). The leprechaumbies are easy to kill and they
give great rewards.</p>
<p>Occasionally, defeating a leprechaumbie causes them to poop at a
zombie boss. These are like doom elites (standard, not Season 1) in that
you must rally attack them regardless of levels. The levels increase at
multiples of 5, so don’t go looking for a level 3 one. These bosses are
unlike regular doom elites in that, at higher levels, they can be really
annoying to kill, making them tough little fitches (get it?
<strong>leprechaumbie and fitch</strong>?). And the difference in
rewards between something like a level 45 and a level 65 is in no way
worth the loss of troops.</p>
<p>Another cool way that these zombie bosses differ from regualar doom
elites is that the person who killed the leprechaumbie that pooped out
the fitch gets a “finders fee” when someone kills that fitch. So you get
rewards even if you don’t kill it. Of course, the catch is that they are
on a timer, so you have to kill them in a set amount of time.</p>
<p>And if this all isn’t enough, let me put a cherry on top of this
Sunday. If you kill the fitch that your spawned you basically get double
rewards.</p>
<p>What I like to do, since the leprechaumbies are so easy to kill, is
to go tile surf (see other tab) and farm with my lower squad so that my
top squad is free to launch the rally on any fitches I spawn.</p>
<p><img src="Images/LepandFitch.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="zombie-invasion-store" class="section level3 active">
<h3 class="active">Zombie Invasion Store</h3>
<p><img src="Images/Trade%20Store.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" /> <br></p>
<p>In theory the most important part of Zombie Invasion is how to
participate. But you’d be amazed how many people participate in Zombie
Invasion for months and have no idea there is a ZOMBIE INVASION STORE!!!
And it’s actually really good. Here’s what you need to know.</p>
<p>Killing Leprechaumbies (level 10 normies) and Fitches (the spawning
zombie bosses) gives you trade store tickets. These can be spent in the
Zombie Invasion Trade Store <strong>as long as the event is currently
live</strong>. But don’t worry, if you don’t manage to spend all of your
tickets, they’ll stay in your inventory until the next time the event is
back in rotation.</p>
<p>I don’t have tons of advice about prioritizing purchases except to
say that my first choice here is always the stamina. Each Leprezaumbie
uses 10 stamina and the zombie bosses require 20. You can run out of
stamina <strong>real fast</strong> farming these lovelies. So stock up
here first.</p>
<p>From there, I typically prioritize hero recruitment tickets. Beyond
that, it really just depends on your needs at the time.</p>
<p>I typically don’t buy valor points or drone parts here because I
don’t think they are better buys than the other stuff in the store and I
never have enough tickets to buy everything.</p>
</div>
<div id="tile-surfing-for-faster-zombie-farming" class="section level3">
<h3>Tile Surfing for Faster Zombie Farming</h3>
<p>The game mechanics set different marching speeds for your squads
based on the activity they are doing. In general, it takes a LOT longer
to get somewhere when you are attacking. It takes about hald the time to
travel to an adjacent resource tile, though, because the march speed for
gathering is so much faster. In other words, if there is a zombie right
next to a gold mine on the map, and you dispatch two squads at the same,
assuming they have equal base march speeds, the squad going to the gold
mine will get to it’s destination almost twice as fast as the one that
you dispatched to the zombie.</p>
<p>So the smart play if you want to attack the zombie is to dispatch
your squad to the gold mine, then attack the zombie from the gold mine
once you are there or right before you get to your location.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take it to the next level for maximum efficiency. There
are so many gold-pot-toting zombies on the map that you can spend lots
of time hunting them. The real pro move for this is what I call “tile
surfing”. The idea is that you find an area with lots of the little
zombies, target a nearby resource tile, transition to the zombie, then
rinse and repeat.</p>

<div id="decorations" class="section level1 tabset tabset-pills">
<h1 class="tabset tabset-pills">Decorations</h1>
<p>Over time, you can make large gains in march power through acquiring
<em>and upgrading</em> decorations. That being said, not all decorations
are created equally. In fact, not even all UR (gold) decorations are
created equally.</p>
All decorations (except for the pyramid and the golden mobile squad)
provide combat boosts and their effects can be found in the Decoration
Gallery in your HQ.
<center>
<img src="Images/Decoration%20Gallery.JPG"
class="enlargeable" style="width:25.0%" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let’s start by reviewing the different levels/rarities of decorations
in the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ornaments</strong>: These decorations are just cosmetic.
They take up space and add aesthetic appeal (if that’s your thing) to
your HQ.</li>
<li><strong>SR Decorations</strong>: These are blue in color (in the
menus). You can get them regularly and for free each day through various
tasks and rewards. They add small combat buffs. DO NOT use universal
pieces to upgrade these.</li>
<li><strong>SSR Decorations</strong>: These decorations are purple in
the menus. You can get them with varying degrees of regularity The
bonuses they provide are better than SR decorations, but they are more
difficult to obtain. DO NOT use universal pieces to upgrade these.</li>
<li><strong>UR Decorations</strong>: These decorations are gold (in the
menus). These are rare, but not all UR decorations are equally rare. The
bonuses are also better than those from SR (blue) and SSR (purple)
decorations, but again, not all UR bonuses are created equally.</li>
</ul>
<div id="super-rare-sr-decorations" class="section level2">
<h2>Super Rare (SR) Decorations</h2>
<p>Super Rare decorations are poorly named as they are actually very
quite common. In fact, you get a UR chest every day when you complete
the full daily task list. Honestly, SR decorations are almost not worth
the space they take up in your base. Almost. There are only four of
them, so it’s not a big deal. Even at level 7, they give negligible
boosts to HP (Bronze Tank and Pacifism), Hero Attack (Bronze Missile
Truck), and Hero Defense (Bronze Aircraft).</p>
<p>Essentially you can ignore these decorations until the game notifies
you that you have collected enough copies of a decoration to upgrade
it.</p>
</div>
<div id="prioritizing-and-upgrading-decorations" class="section level2">
<h2>Prioritizing and Upgrading Decorations</h2>
<p>Each decoration has 6 levels. Nearly all decorations offer the same
type of level 1 and 2 buffs: Hero HP, Attack Power, Defense. Although
the bonuses increase in a fairly linear fashion for all rarities, the
more rare UR decorations become FAR more valuable at level 3. This isn’t
because the percentage increase jumps but because the extra bonuses are
far more valuable than HP, Attack Power, and Defense. These bonuses
include Skill Damage increases, Critical Hit damage increases, increased
damage to monsters, and increases to march size. I’ll refer to these
simply as <em>special bonuses</em>.</p>
<p>Hit points bonuses aren’t very important in the grand scheme of
things. When you consider that a 5-star level 150 Kimberly has over 2
million HP, why do we care about even 50,000 more?</p>
<p>Attack power and Defense buffs are better enough than HP to
prioritize those bonuses in a decoration, but they aren’t really what
you want to focus on. For example, a level one decoration may boost all
hero attack power by 300. But you can get similar increases, albeit on
an individual hero basis, by simply upgrading gear. Nevertheless, Attack
Power and Defense are still generally preferable to Hit Point
bonuses.</p>
<p>What this all means is that you ideally want to target the more rare
UR decorations that give bonuses to attack or defense in the first two
levels and then add one of the special bonuses above once you get to
level 3. This is because the special bonuses are those that are very
hard to come by any other way in the game. For example, apart from the
rare UR decorations, bonuses to skill damage really only come from the
HQ effect cosmetics that have to be acquired from spending money on
special events. Hit points, attack power, and defense, on the other
hand, can be increased through many other avenues.</p>
<p>It’s worth stating the obvious: If you have enough named
(non-universal) decoration pieces to upgrade a decoration you should
always go ahead and upgrade the decoration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="paying-to-win" class="section level1">
<h1>Paying to Win</h1>
<p>Like it not, this game is pay to win. It’s not pay to play, but if
you want to achieve max bonuses, unlock the best gear, grab those
amazing cosmetics, and defeat your opponents, the amount you spend
matters. In our alliance (#421; lfG), I make a big deal not to pressure
people to spend real money. In fact, our leadership team has been
instructed not even to suggest people spend money on this game. But I
have invested plenty of money in this game, and there are <em>lots</em>
of people who have invested thousands of REAL US DOLLARS in this game.
It’s a serious business.</p>
<p>Many people think the idea that spending any money at all on a free
game is absurd. People are allowed to feel however they want. But let me
offer some of my perspective on this. I used to run a lot. I got to
where I got sad if I wasn’t running 4-8 miles a day. One thing that’s
awesome about running is that you can do it for free. However, you can
also spend hundreds of dollars on high-performance shoes. You can add
hundreds more in fancy attire and supplements. You can even pay money to
run at the same time as other people in a thing called a race, which is
wild, because you can basically challenge anyone to a foot race for the
price of zero dollars.</p>
<p>I have a buddy who is big into golfing. He tells me that depending on
the course, a person could expect to pay a median greens fee in the
range of $50 - $100 for 18 holes. Now let’s say my buddy does that this
Friday. He drops $100 on 18 holes and 2 rounds of beers and has 4 hours
of fun on a Friday afternoon. When that’s over, he’s got nothing to show
for it. But who cares? He works hard for his money and had a good time
when he spent it.</p>
<p>I see the game the same way. If I play this game for 4 hours on
Friday night and have a blast pushing VS, doing Desert Storm, rallying
Marshall and lighting up HQs in Enemy Buster, and chatting with all my
friends in the alliance who are doing the same, who cares if I spent $50
on game packs? I had a blast, and the $50 helped me win some of those
close battles. I have just as much to show for it as my buddy who played
a round of golf.</p>
<p>My final take is this: I work for a living. I make money for my work.
I have played this game for multiple hours probably every day since I
downloaded it. That’s hundreds of hours of enjoyment. Some people spend
$100 a month just on tipping the barista who pours their iced coffee
each morning. The absurdity of tipping as a system of payment is a
conversation for another blog. But I think the Devs of this game do a
lot more work to ensure my enjoyment than the myriad folks nowadays who
flip the iPad and tell me there’s a question I need to answer. And I
think the devs deserve to make money for that work. So I’m not going to
feel bad buying game packs to support them. Just like with my server at
the restaurant, it’s not their fault they make more money if I spend
more and tip better.</p>
<p>In sum, you work hard for your money and if you can afford to spend
some on this game, then that’s your business. If you don’t want to spend
any money, that’s cool, too. This is a free game. There are many people
in this game who have really powerful accounts and have spent $0 or a
couple of bucks at most. You just have to grind it out and be smart.
That’s what this strategy guide is for. If you want to spend money,
though, there are also smart ways to do it. I’m going to give you my top
5 in-game spends here as well as some pay-to-win grabs that I think you
might want to avoid.</p>
<div id="top-5-in-game-purchases" class="section level2">
<h2>Top 5 In-Game purchases</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Construction Queue 2 for $1.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/2ndbuilder.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>Think of this as purchasing time. You don’t have to wait nearly as
long in real life to enjoy new parts of the game if you build multiple
buildings at once. To put it another way, this is like paying $2 for a
permanent 50% construction buff (you’re doing twice the building now in
the same amount of time as a single). There is a way to “rent” the
second building queue for diamonds when you need it. That’s a great
option for free-to-play people, but I think $2 here is money very well
spent. And think of it like this. Since you no longer have to rent the
builder with diamonds, you’re essentially purchasing a boat load of
future diamonds with that $2. I mean who doesn’t love a good BOGO!?</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Second Tech Center for $9.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/2ndtech.png"
class="enlargeable" style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>When you get into later game (like HQ27 and up), the emphasis shifts
drastically to upgrading your tech. There are SOOOOOO many tech upgrades
and they start getting into taking multiple weeks to finish. You really
can’t compete at the highest levels if you don’t have a lot of upgrades.
And you can technically upgrade everything in the game with one tech
center, but man does it take forever. A second tech center can also add
some extra oomph to VS and Arms Race events that reward tech power
increases.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Kimberly (UR Tank Hero) for $.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/Kim99.webp"
class="enlargeable" style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>This list used to have 1a as the second construction queue and 1b as
Kim. She’s fallen a little bit recently because the game no longer
forces you to upgrade the tank center in order to get to higher HQ
levels. Nevertheless, Kim remains pound-for-pound the best hero purchase
in the game. There are other UR heroes that are comparable (Stetman in
particular), but you typically have to spend $5 on the “Take All” daily
sale to unlock him (See number 5 for more info about Daily Must
Buys).</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Construction Queue 3 for $9.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/3rd%20builder.PNG"
class="enlargeable" style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>This is nowhere near the steal that the second construction queue is,
but it’s still a tremendous value. Hero power is great, but I think the
best purchases in the game are the ones that save you time. Even with
multiple stacked construction buffs and the appointment to Secretary of
Development, high level HQ upgrades can take a month or more. And the
tech center, tank (or missile or aircraft) centers, barracks, hospitals
and the wall aren’t far behind. Only having one or even two constuction
queues will get you bottlenecked for growth in the long run.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>“Take All” Daily Must Buy for $4.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/Daily%20Must%20Buy.PNG"
class="enlargeable" style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p>The Daily Must Buy “Take All” deal is great. Every day you get a
chance to get 10 hero-specific UR shards and some other assorted rewards
for $4.99. This is how I have unlocked multiple UR heroes. You can
unlock some by random chance with legendary recruitment tickets, but
these offers are the fastest and most efficient way to do so. I never
buy the individual packages for a legend, btw. I always buy the “Take
All” deal. And you can always click the arrows icon to change which hero
you’re buying.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honorable Mention 1: Survivor Taylor for $4.99</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This one might surprise you. But when you pay $4.99 to unlock Taylor,
she immediately gets to work. You’ll deploy her to your headquarters and
every day from then on out, you’ll get 5 adventurer Taylor chests (1
with each of your first 5 daily radar scans). Early on, these can have a
UR Decoration to put in your base, though the odds of landing one seem
to frop dramatically after the first level or two. But every day I get
my five free chests.</p>
<p><img

class="enlargeable" style="width:20.0%" /></p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honorable Mention 1: Golbez’s Stategy Guide</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok… so this one is clearly shameless self promotion. I’m happy to
offer this as a free and ad-free resource, especially to my own
alliance.</p>
<p>That being said, I spend a lot of time getting this in shape to help
people out. I’ve spent more money on this game than I’ll ever tell my
wife about, so I know what good and bad buys look like in this game. I
promise you, this blog is worth at least a $5 donation, even if I am
being completely biassed and self-serving.</p>
<p>So in case you just needed a second chance to consider, I’d really
appreciate the support.</p>

<div id="purchases-i-advise-against" class="section level2">
<h2>Purchases I Advise Against</h2>
<p>Look, you’re free to spend your money how you like. It’s not my
business to tell what to buy and what not to buy. Instead, let’s just
say these are purchases in the game that I personally feel have very
little value.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Radar Replenish for $4.99</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This little bastard gets people all the time. It’s super tempting
because for the the low price of 5 dollars you can basically buy 1
Million vs points (assuming you’ve maxed out the tech center boost for
radar scans) with the possibility of getting a dig.</p>
<p>In general, though, I don’t like purchases like these that do not
have staying power. In other words, unlike a hero purchase that I get to
keep as long as I play the game, a radar replenish has no value 30
seconds after you finish the scans. You may have gotten a few treasure
chests and some VS points, but you can’t really point to something like
a new hero of second building queue that you have to show for your
money. As such, it’s my number one buy to avoid.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Diamond Packs for multiple amounts</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Say what you want about the greedy devs trying to stick their hands
in your Apple wallet, these folks hand out premium in-game currency all
the time. Most pay-to-win games are super stingy with premium currency,
but you can easily rack up thousands of diamonds a day without buying a
single one. And every time the devs think an update may have hurt
someone’s feelings that send you 100 diamonds in your System Mail inbox.
With so many chances to get these resources for free, I’m a hard pass on
recommending folks spend any real money on them.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Pure Random Draws</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t have a great example in my head, but some of the items you
can purchase work off a random roll of some digital dice. I don’t like
it. If you want to gamble, go somehwere they serve free drinks on the
floor. I’ve only bought game packs in one special events mode and that
was sportsopoly and only because it was an unusually cheap way to get
legendary gear blueprints. And there were counters and mechanics that
rewarded you for each purchase despite the presence of a random game
mechanic. But if I see a purchase option and’s totally independent
draws, I steer clear.</p>
