<h1>Leadership Updates</h1>
<p>There are more big changes to announce.</p>
<p>Most of you know that several months ago I stepped down as R5 to
focus on getting my personal life back in balance. Shorty stepped in and
has done a fantastic job of keeping this alliance from dissolving. And
we finished higher in the Season rankings than we ever have and with way
fewer people active than we’ve had in the past. Many of you have no idea
the amount of work and negotiating it takes to get through a season
because most of the communication happens among R5s in discord channels.
No one has the time to manage all of that and then communicate every
single thing that comes up along the way. It takes a lot of trust in
knowing that sometimes situations that you think are bad are actually
“the best terrible option we could arrange.” So again, I want to thank
Shorty for everything she did, especially when some of our
long-standing, strong members were leaving and many of the rest of us
were planning to do so. She refused to let us all fall apart, and I’m
very grateful for that.</p>
<p>All of that being said, things in my life have achieved a bit more
harmony and so Shorty and I are evolving the leadership of the alliance.
I am going to take over R5 tonight and handle this transition to the new
alliance. Shorty will rotate back in as R5 most likely the next time the
server president swaps back to Pickle. We will likely continue swapping
at these same times, or we may arrange a situation where Short is R5
during the seasons and I am R5 during the off-season.</p>
<p>Shorty isn’t going anywhere when I take over. This has been and
continues to be a collaborative effort. Shorty and I communicate a lot
about this game and have been even when I stepped away. What’s more, we
have a tremendous group of R4s who always provide feedback and advice
about how things are going.</p>
<p>Speaking of R4s, you are going to notice some changes there, too. HMB
is going to have 3 seats when they get here. A fourth seat will be
opened and left that way for a few weeks while we see if there are any
other transfers who are interested and might be able to bring knowledge
and perspective from their former servers. You can expect some rotations
of familiar faces in the coming months. It might take some getting used
to, but learn fast because we are going to be a completely different
alliance soon.</p>
<p>Again, I want to thank you all for your patience. I know this seems
silly because we are playing a game, but I believe at this point we know
that most of us see this as more than just a way to pass time while we
are on the toilet. If you have any questions or concerns about this,
just think about what I always tell Don. Just kidding. Ask me or Shorty
whatever you want.</p>
